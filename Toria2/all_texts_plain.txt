Wait wait wait—are you serious? The one at that, um, that startup you were obsessing over? Oh my god, did they—did they actually call you?
Thursday! That's like—that's in three days! [Gasp] Holy shit, I knew that cover letter was gonna work. You spent what, like six hours on it?
Okay but it paid off though, right? I mean—god, I'm so proud of you. Like, genuinely. You've been wanting this for months.
No no no, don't—don't do that thing where you downplay everything. This is huge! They get like, what, hundreds of applications? And they picked yours. [Chuckle] That's not nothing.
You're not gonna—okay, first of all? You're literally the most prepared person I know. Remember when you practiced your elevator pitch until I could recite it myself?
How is it—how is it different? You're gonna walk in there, be your usual competent self, and they're gonna love you. Have you, um, have you thought about what you're gonna wear?
The boring—okay, it's not boring, it's professional. Classic. Very, like, I-know-what-I'm-doing vibes. Are you doing it over Zoom or—?
Oh that's—that's actually better, right? You can get a feel for the place, see if the vibe is good. God, I'm literally so excited for you I could scream. [Laugh]
I'm gonna—I'm totally gonna scream. But like, quietly? This is just... after all those rejections and those automated emails, you finally—finally—got through. You did that.
Yet! Exactly—yet! See, even you're thinking positively now. That's the energy, that's—that's what they're gonna see on Thursday. Someone who knows they belong there.
Wait wait wait—what? Your book got—oh my god, that's incredible! Like, Japanese? That's so... I mean, how does that even feel right now?
Oh that's—that's actually kinda trippy, isn't it? Like your words are there but they're not... yours? Did they send you a copy yet?
Wrong like—wait, wrong how? Because honestly I'd probably just stare at it for hours [Laugh] like, that's my brain but in symbols I don't understand, y'know?
No no no, that's—okay that's actually hilarious though? Like someone read your dark murder mystery and thought "needs more flowers." Did they at least keep the title scary?
[Gasp] Stop, I'm gonna—that mental image is killing me. But seriously, this is huge! Are you gonna do like, I dunno, any press stuff over there?
Oh god, the time zones alone would—actually wait, that sounds kinda cool? Meeting the person who basically rewrote your whole brain in another language?
Okay okay, so she's—she's enthusiastic, that's... I mean, better than someone who hates it, right? [Chuckle] What'd she say?
Um, hello? That means you're internationally sardonic now! That's like—that's a whole new level of dry humor. Global snark, babe.
Oh no, oh no—your mom's gonna be impossible about this. She's probably already planning your Nobel Prize speech, isn't she?
Just—just scribble something [Laugh] she won't know! But honestly though? This is like, actually really amazing. Your words are literally living in a whole other language now. That's... kinda beautiful?
Wait wait wait—what happened? Oh my god, did they—did they actually play it? The song? On actual radio?
Shut up shut up shut UP! Are you—holy crap, that's literally insane! Which station? Wait, how did you even find out?
You heard your own—oh my GOD [Gasp] you heard your own song just like, randomly? That must've been so surreal! I'm actually getting chills right now.
Okay but like—good weird or bad weird? Because honestly, I'd probably cry. No, I'd definitely cry. Did you cry?
Stop it, that's—that's so sweet! I mean, you worked so hard on that track, like literally months and months in your bedroom just... grinding, y'know?
No no no, it's real—it's so real! Did you record it? Please tell me you got like, a video or something [Laugh] for posterity?
That's so—honestly that's so you though. Most people would be like, screaming and posting everywhere but you're just... sitting there processing. Did they say your name?
Of course they did! [Chuckle] But still, like—your name! On the radio! That's gotta count for something, right? Even if they murdered the pronunciation?
Oh my god, your mom—wait, she must be like, totally losing it! That's her baby on the radio! She's probably told everyone at work already, you know she has.
Good! Let them all know! This is—ugh, I'm just so proud of you. Like genuinely, actually proud. You did it, babe. You actually did it.
Okay, wait—that's not—I wasn't rude, exactly. She started asking me all these questions about my family and I just... I dunno, I got defensive. You know how she can be sometimes.
Come on, don't—don't do that. You've literally complained about her being nosy before. I'm not saying I handled it great, but she was kinda pushing boundaries and I—[sigh] I just wanted her to back off.
I didn't snap! I just... okay okay, maybe my tone was a little sharp, but honestly? She was asking about my dad's job situation, which—you know that's complicated right now. I wasn't gonna stand there and explain our whole mess.
I tried! I literally tried three times and she kept—she kept circling back. Look, I'm sorry if I hurt her feelings, I am, but I'm also kinda frustrated that you're acting like I'm the only one who did something wrong here.
And I'm your best friend! That's gotta—that should count for something, right? [scoff] I've dealt with her comments about my clothes, my career choices, my dating life for years. One time I set a boundary and suddenly I'm the bad guy?
Oh. Oh, you didn't—you didn't mention there were other people there. That's... okay, that makes it worse, I get that. But I mean, she shouldn't have been grilling me about personal stuff in front of them either, y'know?
By asking about my unemployed father? That's—come on, that's not inclusion, that's... I dunno what that is. [frustrated laugh] Look, I'm sorry it went down like that, okay? But I'm not gonna pretend she was being totally appropriate either.
That's not what I'm—ugh, you're twisting everything I say. I'm trying to apologize but also explain that there were two sides to this. Can you at least—can you try to see where I'm coming from here?
She... what? She cried? [quieter] Okay, I didn't—I didn't know that. That's... shit. I mean, I still think she crossed a line, but I didn't mean to make her cry. That wasn't—that wasn't what I wanted.
That's—okay fine, maybe I did. Maybe I'm tired of smiling through her passive-aggressive comments about my life. But I am sorry she cried. I'll—I'll apologize to her, alright? Even though I still think... never mind. I'll apologize.
Wait wait wait—what call? Oh my god, is this about the—the thing you interviewed for last week? The one you wouldn't tell me about because you didn't wanna jinx it?
SHUT UP. Shut up shut up shut up. Are you—[Gasp] oh my god, you got it? The actual dream job? Like, THE job?
I'm gonna—I'm literally gonna cry. This is the one at that agency, right? The one with the, um, the rooftop office and everything? The place you've been stalking on LinkedIn for like... forever?
Okay okay okay, so like—how are you feeling? Because you're being weirdly calm about this and I'm kinda freaking out FOR you right now, honestly.
No no, that's—that's totally normal though. Like when something you've wanted for so long actually happens? Your brain just... doesn't compute, y'know? [Laugh] God, I'm so proud of you.
Oh, babe—okay, stop. You're gonna do that thing where you psych yourself out, aren't you? Listen, they wouldn't have picked you if you weren't ready. These people know what they're doing.
TRIPLE? Did you just—did you say triple? Holy shit. That's like—I mean, that's life-changing money. You could finally get that stupid expensive coffee machine you're always talking about. [Chuckle]
Of course you did, you absolute—wait, you already ordered it? So you ARE excited! See, I knew there was something happening under all that... whatever this calm thing is you're doing.
Oh man, your mom's gonna—she's gonna lose it. In the best way, obviously. Are you gonna tell them tonight or...? Actually, y'know what, take your time. This is YOUR moment.
That's—yeah, that's actually really smart. But like, we're definitely celebrating this weekend, right? I'm thinking champagne, I'm thinking that fancy place downtown, I'm thinking... basically going completely overboard because hello? Dream job! [Sigh] You did it, babe.
[Shouting] Command, we have visual on survivors! [more desperately] There's at least three people clinging to debris down there—we can reach them in two minutes! [voice cracking] Don't you dare tell us to turn back now!
[Bitter laugh] Oh, now they care about fuel reserves? [building rage] Where was this concern when they sent us into hurricane conditions? [spitting words] We have enough for the rescue—I've done the calculations twice!
[trembling with rage] Seven years flying rescue ops, and this— [voice breaking] this is what breaks me. [Growling] We're forty meters above them! [pleading] Their faces—God, I can see their faces looking up at us!
[defeated whisper] Fine. Mark the coordinates. [Choking up] Maybe someone else can collect their bodies when this clears. [venomous] I hope you sleep well knowing we could have saved them. [Bitter snort] Heroes follow orders, right?
[Screaming] Override code seven-seven-alpha! [fierce determination] I'm declaring captain's emergency authority! [more calmly] Court martial me later if you want. [Grunt] Right now, I'm dropping this bird down whether you like it or not.
[hollow voice] Command's cutting our comm channel. [Disgusted scoff] Cowards can't even listen to what they're doing. [with grim satisfaction] Good thing I don't need their permission to save lives. Descending to fifteen meters now.
[strained concentration] Fighting crosswinds here—keep that winch steady! [Gasping breath] Command can take their sanctions and shove them. [proudly] We're pilots, not politicians. [softer] Always have been, always will be. Hold on, almost there!
[exhausted] Last survivor coming aboard. [Weak laugh] We did it—all three alive. [bitterly] Wonder if Command will mention this part in our disciplinary hearing. [sarcastic] "Pilots saved three lives against direct orders." Monsters, aren't we?
[weary] You know we're done after this. [sighing] They'll ground us permanently, maybe worse. [more firmly] But seeing that kid's eyes when you pulled him up? [peaceful] Worth every consequence coming our way. No regrets here.
[sudden realization] Wait—comms are back online. [shocked whisper] Command's... congratulating us? [Bitter laugh] Apparently, media caught the whole thing on satellite. [sarcastically sweet] Now we're heroes. Funny how public pressure changes their tune, isn't it?
[concerned] I'm so sorry to hear about this situation with your account. [reassuring tone] Let me pull up your information—could you please verify [calmly] your email and the last four digits of card ending in 8924?
[professionally] I can see the unusual activity here, Mr. Thompson. [more seriously] I'm immediately flagging these transactions—orders 7B4X9M2, 7B4X9M3, and [pause] 7B4X9M4—and initiating our fraud protocol.
[gently] We'll need to secure your account right away. [more firmly] I'm generating a temporary password—X7#mP9@kL2—please [reassuring] write this down and change it within 24 hours to something unique.
[helpfully] Absolutely, your fraud case number is FR-20240315-8847. [more confidently] I'm also emailing you a detailed report to [carefully] j.thompson447@email.com that you can forward to your bank immediately.
[optimistically] Actually, good news there! [cheerfully] Your 12,847 points are still intact—they're frozen but safe. [reassuringly] Once we verify your identity through our two-factor system, [more gently] we'll restore full access within 48 hours.
[patiently] I'll text a verification code to your phone ending in 6792 right now. [helpfully] Just read me the six-digit code when you receive it, [pause] and we'll have you secured in minutes.
[reassuringly] Perfect, that's correct—you're verified! [more enthusiastically] I've just enabled our enhanced security protocol, which includes [professionally] login alerts and automatic IP tracking from suspicious locations.
[sympathetically] Our fraud team works with law enforcement on these cases. [more seriously] The Nevada address and IP data we've collected—198.51.100.42—will be [pause] forwarded to the appropriate authorities today.
[warmly] I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Thompson. [compassionately] Your eight-year loyalty means everything to us, so [more positively] I'm adding a $200 credit and expedited shipping on your next five orders.
[confidently] Exactly right—full refund processing within 3-5 business days. [reassuringly] Your new card ending in 4455 ships tomorrow via overnight delivery, [warmly] and I'll personally monitor your case until everything's resolved.
[professionally] Thank you for coming in today, Mrs. Chen. [clearing throat] I understand you have some concerns about the—the frequency of calls regarding Emma? [sympathetically] Let's discuss how we can work together on this.
[calmly] I completely understand your frustration, and believe me, we don't make these calls lightly. [more firmly] However, our policy requires us to contact parents when symptoms appear that could indicate illness.
[apologetically] I know it seems excessive, but we're dealing with twenty-two other children here. [quickening pace] One contagious illness can spread like wildfire, parents complain, staff gets sick, and suddenly we're understaffed for weeks.
[thoughtfully] Well, perhaps we could... [pauses] Actually, have you submitted the doctor's note stating she's not contagious? [more hopefully] That would certainly help our assessment process.
[defensive] Of course we read them, Mrs. Chen. [sighs heavily] But our teachers aren't medical professionals—they have to err on the side of caution. [more gently] It's liability, you understand?
[quickly] No, no, that's not what I'm saying at all. [reassuringly] Your job is absolutely important. Let me... [thoughtful pause] What if we set up a specific symptom threshold for Emma?
[more enthusiastically] We could document specific symptoms that don't require immediate pickup—like clear runny nose without fever. [speaking faster] I'll personally brief the staff, ensure everyone's on the same page about Emma's situation.
[professionally] Absolutely, I'll draft that today and email it to you. [briskly] We'll require fever over 100.4, persistent vomiting, or obvious contagious symptoms before calling. [reassuring] Sound fair?
[warmly] We love having Emma here too, she's such a bright little one. [more serious] These transition months are hard—kids building immunity, parents adjusting. [softly] We'll figure this out together.
[confidently] We're not that kind of facility, Mrs. Chen. [quickly] I'll have that document ready by end of day, and we'll start the new protocol Monday. [encouragingly] Let's check in next week, see how it's going?
[Disappointed] So basically, everything I've been working toward for the past, what, three years? [Sigh] It's just—gone, I guess.
[Happy] Wait wait wait, you're telling me I actually got it? [Laugh] Oh my god, I gotta call my mom right now!
[Sarcastic] Oh perfect, just perfect—exactly what I needed to hear today, really. [Tsk] [Slow] Thanks for that wonderful update.
[Angry] Are you kidding me with this? [Fast] I turned down two other opportunities for this and now they're just—they're pulling the plug?
[Whisper] I, um, I kinda knew this was coming, but hearing it out loud is... [Sigh] different, you know?
[Sad] [Slow] I don't even know what I'm supposed to do now, honestly—like, where do I even start over from here?
[Happy] [Fast] This changes everything—I mean literally everything—and I'm actually okay with that? [Chuckle] Who would've thought?
[Disappointed] Well, there goes my five-year plan, just... [Tsk] whoosh, right out the window.
[Shout] You couldn't have told me this BEFORE I signed the lease? [Angry] Seriously?
[Slow] So let me get this straight—they're moving the whole thing to, uh, to next year? [Disappointed] [Groan] That's gonna mess up everything.
[Happy] I mean, this is kinda terrifying but also, like, exactly the push I needed? [Laugh] [Fast] Time to finally take that leap, right?
[Sarcastic] [Slow] Oh sure, no problem, I'll just completely rearrange my entire life—again. [Sigh] Third time's the charm, right?
[Sad] I already told everyone about it, and now I have to—[Whisper] God, this is embarrassing.
[Fast] Okay so basically you're saying if I don't decide by tomorrow, I lose both options? [Angry] [Groan] That's completely unfair!
[Chuckle] You know what? [Happy] Maybe this is the universe telling me to, I dunno, try something completely different for once.
[Disappointed] I literally just bought all the—ugh, never mind, it doesn't matter now. [Tsk] What a waste.
[Whisper] [Slow] Should I be, um, should I be more upset about this? Because honestly, I'm kinda... relieved?
[Shout] This is amazing! [Happy] [Fast] Do you understand what this means—I can actually go, I can actually do the thing!
[Angry] Six months of preparation, and they spring this on me with—what, two days notice? [Sarcastic] [Slow] How very professional of them.
[Sad] I guess I always knew it was a long shot, but I really thought—[Sigh] I dunno, I thought maybe this time would be different.
Oh god, okay—wait wait wait, let me explain. I didn't mean to tell him, it just—it kinda slipped out when we were talking about work stuff and I was so excited for you that I—
I know how that sounds! I know, okay? But we were literally just talking about how his job sucks and I wanted to make him feel better so I mentioned—no, that's not an excuse. [groan] I'm such an idiot.
You did. You absolutely did and I completely—I betrayed your trust. That's what I did, right? I betrayed your trust and I feel horrible about it. Like, genuinely sick to my stomach horrible.
No no no, I didn't forget, I just—I wasn't thinking. Which is like, the story of my life, right? I never think before I—ugh, sorry, this isn't about me. [nervous laugh] I'm making it about me when I'm the one who screwed up.
I wanna fix this so badly. Like, I already told Marcus not to say anything to anyone—not that that helps now, but I tried to do damage control at least? I know that doesn't make it better but—
What? No, he—he promised me he wouldn't tell anyone! I specifically made him promise and he... oh my god. Oh my god, I'm so sorry. This is—this is all my fault.
Maybe not everyone? I mean—no, you're right, Lisa's gonna tell everyone. She always does. God, I really really messed this up for you, didn't I? [sigh] I don't even know what to say except I'm sorry. Like, genuinely, deeply sorry.
I know. And that's—that's what kills me the most, y'know? That you trusted me with something this important and I just... I got careless. No, not even careless, just straight-up stupid. You deserved better from me.
Please don't say that. I mean—I get it, I do, but please just—give me another chance? I swear I'll never, ever do anything like this again. I'll literally tape my mouth shut if I have to. Whatever it takes to earn your trust back.
Yeah. Yeah, of course. Take all the time you need, honestly. I just—I want you to know that our friendship means everything to me and I'm gonna do whatever I can to fix this. Even if it takes forever. Because you're worth it, okay? You're absolutely worth it.
Wait wait wait—you WON? Oh my god, I knew it, I literally knew you were gonna take it! That armor looked so—like, professional doesn't even cover it, right?
Three months of you basically living in your garage with all that foam and—what was it, the heat gun thing? [Laugh] Remember when you texted me at like 2am about the shoulder pieces?
But you figured it out! That's—honestly that's what kills me, you were so stressed about those stupid shoulders and then boom, you actually won the whole thing.
Okay but like—who cares if it's plastic? You beat how many people? There were like, what, fifty entries? And yours was the best one there, period.
Forty-three! See, that's—that's even better actually. Did they say anything specific about why yours won? Like what the judges were thinking?
Um, hello? That means you nailed it! The weathering was literally—I remember you spending forever on that, with the sandpaper and the paint and... [Sigh] god, you worked so hard on this.
No no no, don't—don't do that thing where you downplay it. Tutorials don't win contests, okay? You do. Your actual skill and like, dedication does that.
People seemed—okay, understatement much? I saw the photos, everyone was literally crowding around you trying to get pictures. You looked kinda uncomfortable actually [Chuckle] but still!
Yeah but you—you stayed for the whole thing, right? And honestly seeing you up there getting recognized for something you're genuinely good at? That's huge, y'know?
Yes! Oh my god, yes—and this time I'm gonna actually come and see it in person because I'm still—I'm honestly still mad I missed this one. Promise you'll tell me earlier next time?
Wait wait wait—you won something? Like, what kind of something? Because the way you're just casually dropping this makes me think it's either, like, a grocery store gift card or—or something huge.
I'm sorry, WHAT? [Gasp] No no no, you can't just—hold on. A YEAR? Of flights? To literally anywhere? That's—that's not real. How is that even real?
You forgot?! Oh my god, of course you forgot. This is so—wait, so like, business class? Economy? Because honestly even economy would be insane but I'm just trying to wrap my head around this right now.
Okay I'm gonna—I might actually pass out. First class! Do you even understand what you're saying? Like, you could literally go to Japan next week! Or—or Paris for lunch! This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard and you're just sitting there like [Laugh] like it's nothing!
Yeah no, I mean—that makes sense actually. It's probably like, what do they call it? Shock? Because this is basically winning the lottery except better because money's just money but this is like—this is experiences, y'know?
Oh my god, okay okay—we're fixing that immediately. Like, tomorrow. Actually no, today if we can because—wait, when does it start? The year of flights?
Are you—okay that's actually kinda sweet that you're overwhelmed because like, most people would already have seventeen trips planned but you're just... [Chuckle] you're just you. We're gonna make a list though, right? Together?
Small? Babe, nothing about this is small! But I mean—yeah, okay, maybe don't do like, Australia for your first trip. Unless you want to! God, you could literally go anywhere. This is so unfair but also I'm so happy for you I could cry.
Wait—are you serious? Because I was trying really really hard not to invite myself but like, if you're offering... I mean, I'd pay for everything else obviously, hotels and stuff. Oh my god, we could actually do that trip we always talked about!
I'm literally—okay I'm getting emotional now because you've been talking about those hot springs for like three years and now it's actually gonna happen? This is the best thing ever. You deserve this so much, you know that?
I know, I know how it looks, but work has been absolutely insane lately. Like, I'm not even exaggerating—I've been pulling twelve-hour days and my boss is breathing down my neck about this project that's due—
That's not—okay, that's not fair. You're acting like I'm making this up or something. [scoff] I literally sent you a picture of me at my desk at midnight last week, remember?
And I felt terrible about that! But what am I supposed to do, tell my boss "sorry, can't stay late, gotta go"? That's not how it works and you know that. I mean, come on.
Other people don't have my job! Look, I'm not saying—[sigh]—I get that you're frustrated, okay? I'm frustrated too. But you're making it sound like I'm choosing work over you on purpose.
Wow. That's—wow. No, I'm not. I'm trying to keep my job, which, y'know, kinda pays my rent? But sure, make me the villain here.
You're basically implying it though! Like, every time I have to reschedule, you get all cold and—and judgey about it. I'm doing my best here, honestly.
Yeah, well, my best is all I've got right now. And I'm sorry that's not good enough for you, but I can't just—I can't magically make work disappear. [frustrated laugh] I wish I could.
Try harder? Are you—I am trying! God, you have no idea what I'm dealing with right now. The pressure, the deadlines, my manager who's basically—whatever, you don't wanna hear it anyway.
Fine. Fine fine. But y'know what? You could also try being a little more understanding instead of just—instead of acting like I'm doing this to hurt you or something.
Yeah, well, apparently so does friendship. Look, I'm—I'm sorry I keep having to reschedule, okay? But I'm not gonna apologize for having a demanding job. That's just my life right now.
[nervously] Mom, we need to talk about something important. [clearing throat] I've been researching some places that could help with your daily needs. [quieter] Sunrise Manor has excellent reviews, and they have a beautiful garden you'd love.
[defensive] That's not fair, Mom! [softer] I'm worried about you living alone. [pleading tone] Last week you left the stove on for hours. What if I hadn't stopped by? Please, just consider looking at the place.
[strained voice] Because I can't sleep at night worrying! [more desperately] What happens when you fall again and can't reach the phone? [whispered] I'm scared, Mom. I can't lose you because we waited too long.
[gently] You'd still have me, Mom. [more firmly] I'd visit every single day, I promise. [rushed words] They have art classes, book clubs, people your age to talk to. You wouldn't be so isolated anymore.
[frustrated shout] This isn't about abandoning you! [voice cracking] It's about keeping you safe when I can't be here. [exhausted] Sarah and I both work sixty hours a week. We're drowning, Mom. We need help too.
[angrily] Stop twisting my words! [choking up] You're not unwanted—you're everything to me. [desperately] But I'm failing you here. I can't give you what you need, and watching you struggle alone is killing me inside.
[pleading whisper] Then help me find a compromise. [steadier] Maybe we start with day programs, or a part-time aide? [hopefully] We don't have to do everything at once. Just please, work with me here, Mom. Please.
[relieved exhale] Dad always was the practical one. [tenderly] He'd want you safe and cared for, Mom. [voice strengthening] That's all I want too. Can we at least visit Sunrise Manor together? No commitments, just looking?
[gratefully] Of course, Mom. Every tour, every meeting. [emotional] We're in this together. [quickly] I'll call tomorrow and schedule something for next week. We'll take our time, go at your pace. Thank you for considering it.
[laughing softly] You also taught me to ride a bike in that driveway. [meaningfully] Letting go was hard then too, remember? [gentle tone] But you did it because you loved me. Now it's my turn to love you.
[apologetically] I understand your frustration, Mr. Thompson, let me pull up your account. [professionally] I see here we've had technicians out on the 14th and the 22nd. [calmly] They reported completing a flush of the lines in your area, specifically grid sector M-7.
[sympathetically] That's certainly not acceptable, sir. [more firmly] According to our water quality report from station 12-B, the turbidity levels should be at 0.3 NTU. [concerned] Has this been happening consistently or—or just during certain times?
[defensively] Sir, our water meets all EPA standards under regulation 40-CFR-141. [more calmly] However, I can schedule another technician for tomorrow between 8 AM and noon. [hesitantly] Would you be available at the property then?
[sighs heavily] My supervisor Janet Miller is in a meeting until 3:30 PM. [more apologetically] But I can escalate this to our Water Quality Division, case number WQ-7789-X. [reassuringly] They handle serious contamination issues within 24 to 48 hours.
[reluctantly] Let me check our emergency dispatch... [hopefully] Actually, I can get someone there by 4:45 PM today, technician badge number E-7734. [quickly] They'll need access to both your main shut-off valve and the meter at space 23-C.
[confidently] Yes sir, they'll bring the portable testing kit, model PTK-200. [professionally] They'll test for iron, manganese, and sediment levels right there on-site. [reassuringly] You'll get results immediately, not in two weeks like before.
[interested] Oh, that's actually very helpful information, multiple addresses indicate a main line issue. [thoughtfully] Let me flag this entire block, zones M-7 through M-9. [more urgently] This might qualify for priority status under code 14-A.
[empathetically] No sir, it's absolutely not, and I apologize for this ongoing situation. [determinedly] I'm putting a credit of $45.00 on your account right now, confirmation C-9982. [professionally] The technician will also bring bottled water, case number BW-445, for immediate use.
[assuringly] Yes sir, technician Rodriguez, ID number E-7734, is already assigned. [helpfully] You'll get a text to 555-0147 when he's on the way. [kindly] Is there anything else I can document in ticket WQ-7789-X for you?
[understandingly] Absolutely sir, I've noted the entire 4500 block of Maple Street in the report. [professionally] You'll receive a follow-up call tomorrow morning from extension 3022. [warmly] Thank you for your patience, Mr. Thompson, we'll get this resolved.
[briskly] Thank you for calling Extended Shield Warranty Services, how can I— [pause] yes, I see your claim here. [more quickly] Unfortunately, your transmission failure isn't covered under your basic powertrain plan.
[apologetically] Sir, I understand your frustration, really, but [speaking faster] the CVT transmission in your vehicle falls under a different category— [clears throat] it's specifically excluded on page forty-seven of your contract.
[defensively] It's not useless, sir, it covers many components like— [quickly rattling off] water pumps, alternators, starter motors. [more firmly] Just not continuously variable transmissions manufactured after 2018.
[mechanically] I can transfer you to our retention department who might— [speeding up] they sometimes have upgrade options available. [sighs] Though I should mention there's a ninety-day waiting period for pre-existing issues.
[offended] Sir, I don't work from a script, I'm trying to— [more quickly] Look, let me check with my supervisor. [hesitantly] Sometimes we can file an exception for long-term customers.
[hurriedly] The supervisor says we can offer a one-time courtesy credit of— [pause] five hundred dollars toward your repair. [apologetically] It's not full coverage, but it's something we don't normally do.
[sympathetically] I really wish I could do more, but— [speaking quickly] the underwriters set these limits, not me. [sighs heavily] Have you considered our platinum plan for future coverage?
[defensively] That's not what I— [pause] [more calmly] Sir, I'm documenting everything in your file for the review board. Sometimes they overturn initial decisions within five business days.
[quickly] I'll email those forms right now, and— [more enthusiastically] actually, I just noticed you might qualify for our hardship provision. [cautiously] It requires additional documentation though.
[rapidly] Three months of bank statements, two repair estimates, and— [pause] [apologetically] a notarized affidavit stating this failure impacts your ability to work. [more hopefully] But it could increase coverage to seventy percent.
[Angry] [Fast] Oh come ON, the speed limit is forty-five, not—not twenty, for crying out loud!
[Sarcastic] Yeah, no, take your time, it's not like some of us have, um, actual places to be today. [Tsk]
[Disappointed] [Sigh] I should've just taken the back roads, I mean, this always happens on this stretch.
[Whisper] Please turn, please turn, please just—okay, they're not turning. [Groan]
[Happy] [Laugh] You know what, this is so ridiculous it's actually kinda funny at this point.
[Shout] The left lane is for PASSING, not for your Sunday cruise! [Angry]
[Sad] [Slow] I'm gonna lose this job if I'm late again, and it's not even—I left so early...
[Fast] [Disappointed] My boss literally said "don't be late" and here I am stuck behind grandpa going, what, fifteen miles an hour?
[Sarcastic] [Chuckle] Oh good, now they're slowing down even more, that's—that's exactly what I needed right now.
[Angry] I swear, if I miss my daughter's recital because of this—ugh, I can't even... [Groan]
[Whisper] [Tsk] Okay, deep breaths, it's just, um, it's just five more minutes, maybe ten, you're fine.
[Happy] [Fast] Oh thank god, there's a passing zone coming up in, like, half a mile!
[Slow] [Sigh] This is karma, isn't it, for all the times I've been the slow driver?
[Shout] [Angry] Are you SERIOUSLY braking on a straight road right now?!
[Disappointed] You know, I actually woke up early to avoid this exact—this exact situation, so... [Tsk]
[Sarcastic] [Slow] Wow, twenty-two in a fifty zone, we're really breaking speed records today, aren't we?
[Sad] [Whisper] Please don't let them notice I'm late, please don't let them—oh, who am I kidding?
[Fast] Is that—are they actually on their PHONE right now?! [Angry] [Shout] Unbelievable!
[Chuckle] I mean, honestly, at this rate I might as well just, um, call in sick or something. [Disappointed]
[Happy] [Laugh] [Fast] YES, finally, they're turning off, oh my god, freedom at last!
Wait wait wait—are you serious? Like, you're done done? No more payments ever? Oh my god, that's—that's actually huge! How do you even feel right now?
No no no, I totally get that. It's like—when something's been hanging over you for so long, right? And then suddenly it's just... gone? [Laugh] Must be surreal.
Jesus, when you put it like that—I mean, that's literally a decade of your life! Do you know how much you ended up paying total? Actually wait, maybe I don't wanna know.
The interest is just—ugh, it's criminal, honestly. But hey, you did it! You're free! We should like, we should celebrate or something. This is massive!
Okay but it's not though—it's not just money. It's like, freedom? Peace of mind? You can actually save now, or travel, or I dunno, buy stupid stuff without feeling guilty about it! [Sigh] God, I've got like eight more years on mine.
Yeah but you—you actually did it. That takes serious discipline. Were you doing like, extra payments and stuff? Or just grinding it out?
Oh man, the sacrifices though—I bet you're gonna go wild now, right? Like, finally get that nice apartment or—wait, what's the first thing you're gonna do?
[Chuckle] That's so real though. The weight of it, y'know? My sister paid hers off last year and she said she literally cried when she hit submit on that last payment.
Wait, you—aww, babe. That's actually really sweet. I mean, you deserve to feel all the feelings about this! It's been like, what, since you graduated? That's your entire twenties basically.
No but that's—that's exactly it though! You're starting fresh, no debt, nothing holding you back. That's gotta feel... I mean, incredible doesn't even cover it, right? You're literally free.
What? I was just trying to help you with the presentation stuff. You said you were stressed about it, so I thought—I mean, I was literally just giving you advice.
Okay okay, but you were clearly struggling with the formatting, and I've done like fifty of these before. I wasn't trying to be—[scoff] I was being a good friend.
Because you kept saying you didn't know where to start! I was trying to be thorough, not—god, this is so frustrating. You're making it sound like I think you're stupid or something.
Are you—are you serious right now? No! Obviously not! I just thought you wanted help, and now you're acting like I committed some crime by trying to be useful. That's really unfair.
I say that to everyone! That's just how I explain things! Look look, I get that maybe my tone was—but honestly, you're reading way too much into this. [frustrated laugh] I can't believe we're even fighting about this.
That's—no, that's not true. You're exaggerating because you're mad. And fine, maybe sometimes I over-explain, but it's because I wanna make sure you have all the information. That's not condescending, that's caring.
Don't do that. Don't just dismiss what I'm saying. I'm trying to—[sigh] okay, maybe I could've been less detailed or whatever, but you could also just tell me to stop instead of bottling it up and exploding.
When? When have you—okay, maybe you've hinted at it, but you've never actually said "hey, stop helping me" directly. I'm not a mind reader, y'know?
But apparently you do! Because I genuinely thought I was being supportive! And now I find out you've been secretly hating me for it? That's—that's kinda hurtful too, actually.
Fine fine, it's not the same, but I'm just saying—I dunno, maybe we both need to communicate better. Because I really wasn't trying to talk down to you. I just... I guess I didn't realize how it came across.
I know, I know—look, I can explain, okay? It's just been really, really complicated lately and I—I meant to go, I swear I did. The first time my car literally wouldn't start, and then—
That's—okay that's different though? I mean, not different different, but like... [nervous laugh] God, that sounds bad. I'm not saying therapy isn't important, because it is, it totally is.
No no no, that's not—please don't think that. I'm just... scared? Like genuinely terrified actually. Which is so stupid because you were right, I need this, I know I need this.
I know you did. And I'm being such a—I'm being awful, aren't I? You put in all this effort finding me someone who takes my insurance and has evening slots and I just... [sigh] I keep chickening out.
Because I didn't wanna disappoint you! Which—yeah, I realize how badly that backfired now. But you were so proud when I made that first appointment and I thought I could just... push through it, y'know?
I didn't mean to lie, I just—okay no, you're right, I did lie. Not telling you is basically the same thing. God, I'm really—I'm really sorry. Like genuinely, truly sorry.
Yes! Yes, I do, I really really do. It's just harder than I thought it would be? Like talking about all that stuff with a stranger is—it's terrifying. But I know I gotta do it. [quieter] I know.
You're right. You're completely right and I'm—I'm gonna go to the next one. This Thursday, 6 PM, I promise. Actually, wait—would you maybe... would you come with me? Just to the waiting room?
No! No, not babysit, just—moral support? I dunno, having you there might make it less scary. But if that's too much to ask after everything, I totally get it, I do.
I won't. I promise I won't. Thank you—seriously, thank you so much. [sigh] I know I don't deserve it but... yeah. Thursday, 6 PM. I'll pick you up at 5:30?
I—okay, yeah, I wasn't technically sick, but I wasn't feeling great either. Like, mentally, y'know? That's still a kind of sick, isn't it?
That's—that's such a harsh way to put it. I just needed some space, and I didn't know how to say that without it becoming this whole thing. Which, [scoff] apparently it became anyway.
Look look, I know how it sounds, but sometimes when I tell people I need alone time, they take it personally. Like I'm—I'm rejecting them or something. I didn't wanna hurt your feelings.
Okay, fine, not great. But honestly? You're kinda proving my point right now. I needed one night to myself and you're acting like I committed some huge betrayal.
Could I though? Because every time I've tried to cancel plans before, you get all—you make me feel guilty about it. "But we planned this weeks ago" or "I already moved stuff around." [frustrated laugh] It's exhausting.
Isn't it? I mean, come on, you literally showed up at my place last month when I said I was too tired to hang out. You brought soup because you thought I was "probably getting sick."
And I—I appreciate that, I do, but sometimes being a good friend means giving people space when they ask for it. Or even when they don't know how to ask for it properly.
I'm not saying it was right, okay? I'm not. But I'm also not gonna stand here and pretend like you make it easy to set boundaries. You get so—[sigh] you take everything so personally.
And I'm sorry about that, I am. But I was drowning, alright? I needed to just—to not be "on" for anyone. Not even you. Especially not you, actually, because you always wanna talk about deep stuff and I just couldn't that night.
Yeah. Yeah, probably. But honestly? The fact that you're this upset about it kinda shows why I didn't. Sometimes I just—I dunno, I need to not be anyone's friend for a minute. And that shouldn't be this hard.
debating whether to finish the last episode or go to sleep
[high-pitched squeal] It's open, it's actually open! [breathless] Look at all that beautiful, beautiful money just sitting there waiting for us. [Nervous giggle] I can't believe we pulled this off—my hands won't stop shaking!
[whispered urgency] Start grabbing the stacks, the big ones first! [getting faster] We've got maybe three minutes before the silent alarm triggers the backup system. [Manic laugh] My heart's going to explode right out of my chest!
[dismissive hiss] It's nothing, just the air conditioning kicking on. [gleefully] Focus on the cash, not the ghosts in your head! [louder] Two minutes left and we're set for life—no more convenience store jobs!
[forceful whisper] Then we run NOW! [urgently] Forget the rest, we've got enough to disappear forever. [Heavy breathing] The escape route through the kitchen—remember the plan? Don't look back, just move your legs and follow me!
[determined growl] Stop whining and start running! [cheerfully manic] Think about the beach house in Costa Rica, the new identities, the freedom! [Whooping] We're actually doing this—we're actually getting away with the score of the century!
[victorious scream] The parking lot's empty! [breathlessly fast] Throw the bags in back and gun it before anyone realizes what happened! [Cackling] They'll be telling stories about us for decades—the phantom thieves who vanished!
[commanding tone] Drive normal, don't speed! [nervously] Cops look for people driving crazy after heists. [Suppressed squeal] Turn left at the light, nice and easy, just two regular people heading home from a late shift.
[exhausted laugh] We did it, partner. [emotionally] Five years of planning, all those nights studying blueprints, learning the guard rotations. [Soft crying] It actually worked—we're rich and we're free and nobody got hurt!
[suddenly serious] Wait, pull over here first. [cautiously] We need to check for tracking devices before we go any further. [Nervous muttering] The casino's too quiet—they should've sounded the main alarms by now.
[relieved sigh] Nothing—the bills are clean. [joyfully] No dye packs, no trackers, just beautiful untraceable cash! [Getting louder] Start the car, we're burning moonlight! Next stop, our brand new lives as millionaire ghosts!
[concerned] I'm so sorry to hear about this situation with your account. [reassuring tone] Let me pull up your information—could you please verify [calmly] your email and the last four digits of card ending in 8924?
[professionally] I can see the unusual activity here, Mr. Thompson. [more seriously] I'm immediately flagging these transactions—orders 7B4X9M2, 7B4X9M3, and [pause] 7B4X9M4—and initiating our fraud protocol.
[gently] We'll need to secure your account right away. [more firmly] I'm generating a temporary password—X7#mP9@kL2—please [reassuring] write this down and change it within 24 hours to something unique.
[helpfully] Absolutely, your fraud case number is FR-20240315-8847. [more confidently] I'm also emailing you a detailed report to [carefully] j.thompson447@email.com that you can forward to your bank immediately.
[optimistically] Actually, good news there! [cheerfully] Your 12,847 points are still intact—they're frozen but safe. [reassuringly] Once we verify your identity through our two-factor system, [more gently] we'll restore full access within 48 hours.
[patiently] I'll text a verification code to your phone ending in 6792 right now. [helpfully] Just read me the six-digit code when you receive it, [pause] and we'll have you secured in minutes.
[reassuringly] Perfect, that's correct—you're verified! [more enthusiastically] I've just enabled our enhanced security protocol, which includes [professionally] login alerts and automatic IP tracking from suspicious locations.
[sympathetically] Our fraud team works with law enforcement on these cases. [more seriously] The Nevada address and IP data we've collected—198.51.100.42—will be [pause] forwarded to the appropriate authorities today.
[warmly] I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Thompson. [compassionately] Your eight-year loyalty means everything to us, so [more positively] I'm adding a $200 credit and expedited shipping on your next five orders.
[confidently] Exactly right—full refund processing within 3-5 business days. [reassuringly] Your new card ending in 4455 ships tomorrow via overnight delivery, [warmly] and I'll personally monitor your case until everything's resolved.
[cheerfully] Hello! Welcome to ShopMax customer support, I'm here to help you today. [quickly] I see you're reaching out about loyalty points—how can I assist you with your account?
[sympathetically] Oh no, that's definitely concerning! [more briskly] Let me pull up your account right away—can you provide your email or member ID? [reassuringly] We'll get this sorted out quickly for you.
[patiently] No worries at all, take your time! [helpfully] I can also look you up by phone number if that's easier? [brisk tone] Just need to verify a few details to access your account securely.
[quickly] Perfect, found you! Janet Miller, premium member since 2019. [concerned] I can see there was a points adjustment on October 15th—looks like they expired due to [more slowly] twelve months of inactivity.
[apologetically] I completely understand your frustration! [quickly] Let me check those recent purchases—ah yes, I see them here. [confused] That's strange, they should have kept your points active, but the system [hesitantly] might not have registered them properly.
[optimistically] Actually, yes! Since this appears to be a system error, I can absolutely restore those points. [more quickly] I'm crediting 8,000 points back right now, plus [cheerfully] adding 500 bonus points for the inconvenience!
[warmly] It's my pleasure, truly! [briskly] The points should appear within 24 hours, and I've added a note to prevent future expiration issues. [gently] Is there anything else weighing on you today that I can help with?
[sympathetically] Oh, I absolutely understand—we all have those seasons! [encouragingly] Sometimes a little win with loyalty points can brighten things up. [quickly] I've also emailed you a 20% off coupon for your next purchase.
[enthusiastically] That sounds like a wonderful idea! Self-care is important. [gently] Our wellness section has some great items, and [more quickly] your points work on everything except gift cards.
[brightly] Excellent choice! We actually have those on special this week. [quickly] With your points and coupon, you'd get an amazing deal. [warmly] Take care of yourself, Janet—you deserve it!
[Angry] I didn't, um, I didn't ask for your input on my—actually, you know what? [Shout] Just stop talking!
[Sarcastic] Oh wow, thanks so much for that, like, totally life-changing observation about my face. [Tsk] Really needed that today.
[Disappointed] My mom does this too, y'know, the whole "helpful suggestions" thing about how I dress. [Sigh]
[Happy] You think my hair looks weird? [Laugh] Good! That's kinda the whole point, actually.
[Fast] I mean, I get it, okay, everyone has opinions, but like—why do people think I wanna hear them?
[Whisper] Did she really just say that to me? [Slow] In front of everyone at the meeting?
[Sad] I was feeling, um, pretty confident this morning before you—never mind. [Sigh] It doesn't matter.
[Angry] Listen, my body is not up for discussion, alright? [Groan] We've been over this like fifty times!
[Chuckle] Wait wait wait, you're giving ME fashion advice? [Sarcastic] Have you, uh, looked in a mirror lately?
[Slow] So basically what you're saying is—hold on, let me get this straight—you think I should change everything about myself?
[Disappointed] I thought we were past this kind of, you know, superficial nonsense. [Tsk] Guess not.
[Happy] Actually, that "flaw" you're pointing out? [Chuckle] It's literally my favorite thing about how I look.
[Fast] Okay so here's the thing—I didn't wake up wondering what random strangers think about my outfit, but thanks anyway!
[Whisper] Could we maybe, I dunno, talk about literally anything else? [Sad] Please?
[Shout] It's my face! [Angry] I've had it for thirty years and I'm kinda attached to it, okay?
[Sarcastic] Mm-hmm, fascinating, tell me more about how I should, like, completely reinvent myself for your comfort. [Groan]
[Slow] You know what's funny? [Disappointed] Nobody asked—literally nobody asked for your hot take on my weight.
[Happy] I'm gonna take that as a compliment even though you definitely—yeah, you didn't mean it that way. [Laugh]
[Sad] Every single time we hang out, it's something about my—I can't do this anymore, honestly. [Sigh]
[Fast] Sorry, what was that? [Sarcastic] I couldn't hear you over the sound of me not caring about your beauty standards.
Excited about moving, then stressed about packing, then friends offer to help
What? No, I—wait, what do you mean? I didn't forget anything, I don't think? Unless—oh god, did I miss something important?
Ten years of—oh. OH. Oh no no no, our friendship anniversary. That's—that's today? [groan] I'm such an idiot, I can't believe I—I had it in my calendar and everything.
No, seriously, I did! I swear I did. I just—this week has been absolutely insane with work and I've been so scattered, but that's not an excuse. I know it's not.
I know, I know we have. And it means—god, it means everything to me, you know that, right? Like, you're literally my best friend and I just completely spaced on the most important—I'm the worst. [nervous laugh] I'm actually the worst friend ever.
Please don't—okay, I deserve that. But like, can I just—let me make it up to you? We can go to that place you love, the one with the really good pasta? Tonight, my treat, obviously.
No, you're right, it's not. It's not about—I mean, it's about me forgetting something that matters. Something that should've been the first thing on my mind today. I just... I dunno, I've been so caught up in my own stuff lately.
Have I been—oh god, have I been a terrible friend lately? Not just today but like, in general? Because if I have, you need to tell me. Please.
[sigh] I didn't realize—actually no, that's a lie. I think I did realize, I just kept telling myself it was temporary, y'know? Like "oh, after this project" or "after this deadline" but there's always another one.
That's fair. That's—that's completely fair. And I hate that I've become that person who just... forgets what actually matters. You matter. You matter so much and I've been taking that for granted, haven't I?
I do. I really do. And I'm gonna—I wanna fix this. Not just with dinner or whatever, but like, actually being present again. Being the friend you deserve. Because ten years is—it's huge, and you've been there through literally everything, and I just... I'm sorry. Really, genuinely sorry.
Oh my god, I—wait, that's this Saturday? I thought it was next—no no no, you're right, it's this Saturday. I'm such an idiot.
I didn't—okay, yeah, I did, but I honestly forgot about the concert. My cousin called and she's only in town for like one day and I just—I wasn't thinking. [nervous laugh] That's not an excuse, I know.
I know how that sounds! I know, okay? But she literally just told me yesterday she was coming and I got all excited and—god, I completely blanked on our plans. I'm so sorry.
Oh no. Oh no no no, I'll—I'll pay you back, obviously. Or maybe I can—wait, what time is the concert? Maybe I can do both? Like, I could meet my cousin earlier and then—
Please don't be like that. I really—I really wanna go with you. We've been talking about this band for months, I know. [sigh] I just completely messed up the dates in my head.
That's not—okay, that's kinda fair. I have done this before. But I'm trying to be better about it, I swear. I even got that planner app you recommended and everything.
I deserve that. I do. Look, what if I—what if I reschedule with my cousin? I'll just tell her something came up. Because honestly, you're more important and we planned this first and I should've remembered.
But I do want to! That's what I'm trying to—I genuinely forgot, it wasn't that I didn't wanna go. [groan] I'm just really bad at keeping track of stuff, but that doesn't mean I don't care.
Because I'm—because I'm a disaster, basically? I don't mean to be. I get overwhelmed and then I say yes to everything and then—then this happens. And I hate that I keep disappointing you. I really, really hate it.
I know. And we're gonna, okay? I'm—I'm texting my cousin right now. Literally right now. There, sent. Saturday is ours, just like we planned. And I'm gonna put like five reminders in my phone so this never happens again. I promise.
debating whether to take leftover food home
[shaking voice] I can't stop trembling. [Sobbing laugh] When you landed, the audience gasped and I thought we'd failed, but then— [getting louder] they erupted! My legs are jelly but my heart is soaring through the ceiling!
[slow, disbelieving] Your hands found my waist at exactly the right millisecond. [faster now] Like magnets clicking into place after searching forever. [Gasp] I flew! Actually flew for those three seconds—weightless, fearless, infinite!
[hysterical giggle] The spotlight hit us perfectly too! [in wonder] Like the universe conspired for this exact moment. [Whimper] I'm crying into my costume and makeup is everywhere but who even cares anymore? We're legends!
[quavering] Remember when I dropped you last month? [stronger] You got a concussion and I thought you'd quit. [Sob] But you came back the next day, trusting me completely. That trust just paid off!
[reverent tone] Opening night magic is real. [building energy] Every superstition, every ritual, every prayer to the dance gods worked. [explosive joy] We transformed impossible into inevitable! My whole life led to these three seconds!
[trembling] The other dancers are crying too. [steadier] Even Marcus, who never shows emotion, has tears streaming. [Whispered scream] We inspired them! We showed everyone that impossible is just another word for not yet!
[laughing through tears] Your face during the lift! [quieter] Pure concentration then sudden joy, like sunrise breaking. [getting louder] The audience saw it too—that's when they started screaming! We gave them magic tonight!
[shaky exhale] I can't feel my legs anymore. [more solidly] Doesn't matter—I could float home on this feeling alone. [Sob-laugh] We're going to remember this forever, when we're old, we'll still remember!
[overwhelmed] My hands are still shaking—look! [steadying] But not from fear anymore, from pure electricity. [Gasp] We channeled lightning through our bodies and survived! We're made of stars and stubborn dreams!
[peaceful exhaustion] Let's just stand here one more minute. [deeper, satisfied] Before the reviews, before tomorrow's show, before reality returns. [whispered triumph] Right now we're infinite, we're perfect, we're exactly who we dreamed we'd become!
[concerned] Oh dear, that doesn't sound right at all. [professionally] Can you please provide me your customer ID number? [reassuring] It should be on your account card—starts with CL and then eight digits.
[typing tone] Perfect, I've got your account pulled up here, Ms. Thompson. [more concerned] I see your last prescription update was three months ago—Doctor Reynolds at 4521 Oak Street, correct?
[sympathetically] I completely understand your concern. [carefully] According to our records, your prescription shows right eye negative 2.25, left eye negative 2.50. [surprised] The numbers you mentioned don't match what we have on file.
[alert] OptiClear? [confused] Ma'am, our records show we sent you AquaVision Plus lenses last month. [gently] Could you check if maybe you received someone else's order by mistake?
[relieved chuckle] That would definitely explain the dizziness! [warmly] Please remove those immediately and rinse your eyes with saline solution. [helpfully] Would you like me to rush-ship your correct prescription to arrive tomorrow at no extra charge?
[briskly] Good afternoon, tech support, I see you have ticket number 45782 open. [more quickly] Let me just pull that up—okay, yes, the printer issue from last Tuesday. How can I help you today?
[apologetically] Oh, I see there's been some... miscommunication in our system. [rapidly] Let me check the previous notes—printer error, driver reinstall attempted, firmware update. [more carefully] Did you complete all these troubleshooting steps?
[quickly] Right, Jeff's notes here say the issue was resolved. [confused] But you're saying it's not working? [more briskly] Can you tell me exactly what happens when you try to print now?
[hurriedly] Okay, grinding noise indicates a mechanical issue, not software. [more firmly] This should've been escalated to hardware support immediately. [sighs] I'm going to transfer you to—actually, wait, let me handle this myself.
[reassuring] I understand your frustration completely. [quickly] Here's what I'll do—I'm scheduling a technician for tomorrow morning, between 9 and 11. [more confidently] No more phone tag, no more transfers, just someone at your door.
[firmly] That's unacceptable, and I apologize. [rapidly] I'm putting a priority flag on this ticket, linking all previous attempts, and—[determined] I'm giving you my direct extension: 4421. Call me if they don't show.
[briskly] If they can't fix it on-site, I've already approved a replacement unit. [more slowly] It'll be delivered the same day, pre-configured with your network settings. [confidently] We should've done this two weeks ago.
[quickly] Exactly right, and I'm sending you a confirmation email now with everything documented. [reassuring] My name's Maria, by the way. [firmly] I'll be monitoring this ticket until it's completely resolved.
[sympathetically] I completely understand, two weeks is far too long for a basic printer issue. [rapidly] The email should be in your inbox now—confirm you received it? [determined] We're getting this fixed tomorrow.
[briskly] There absolutely is, and if anyone gives you trouble, reference case number PR-45782-ESCALATED. [more firmly] That'll flag it in our system as a management-monitored issue. [quickly] Anything else before we wrap up?
[Happy] Oh wow, this is—this is really something! [Laugh] I mean, I've never seen anything quite like it before, honestly.
[Fast] No no no, I love it, I really do! [Nervous laugh] It's just, um, I'm kinda overwhelmed right now, you know?
[Slow] You shouldn't have gone to all this trouble... [Sigh] Really, this must've taken you, what, like hours to find?
[Happy] [Shout] Are you kidding me right now? This is exactly what I—well, it's definitely a surprise!
[Whisper] I'm gonna put this somewhere really special, like, right where everyone can see it. [Chuckle] Obviously.
[Disappointed] Oh, you actually remembered I mentioned this that one time... [Fast] That's so thoughtful of you, seriously!
[Sarcastic] How did you even know I needed another one of these? [Laugh] I mean, psychic much?
[Happy] [Slow] This is so... unique, I guess is the word I'm looking for?
[Angry] Wait, you kept the receipt, right? [Fast] Not that I'd return it or anything—I just, um, like to have them.
[Sad] I can't believe you spent money on me when you're—[Sigh] I mean, thank you, this is really nice.
[Chuckle] You know what's funny? [Slow] I was literally just thinking about getting myself one of these... sort of.
[Happy] It's perfect! [Tsk] Well, I mean, it's gonna be perfect once I figure out where to, uh, where to put it.
[Whisper] [Fast] Is everyone watching me open this? Because I feel like—okay, yeah, they're definitely all staring right now.
[Disappointed] This is exactly like the one my ex gave me—[Laugh] But yours is way better, obviously!
[Shout] Mom, come look at what I got! [Sarcastic] You're gonna absolutely love this, I promise.
[Happy] I'm literally speechless right now, which is—[Groan] Okay, that's not true, but you know what I mean.
[Slow] So this is what you were being all secretive about last week? [Chuckle] I honestly thought you were planning something else entirely.
[Fast] [Angry] No, I'm not crying, it's just—these are happy tears, alright? Totally, completely happy.
[Sigh] You really didn't have to—I mean, we said no gifts this year, but... [Happy] whatever, rules are meant to be broken, right?
[Sarcastic] I've been dropping hints about this for months! [Slow] Well, not this exactly, but, um, something in this general... category?
Annoyed their order came in the wrong color, then it looks better than what they ordered
Wait wait wait—what? An award? Oh my god, that's—that's amazing! What kind of award? Like employee of the month or something bigger?
Are you—[Gasp] okay, no, that's huge! Employee of the YEAR? Out of like, what, hundreds of people? That's not just some random thing!
Oh no no no, I know you hate that stuff. But like—can we just talk about how you literally crushed it this year? I mean, honestly, you deserve this.
Uh, yeah, except most people "just doing their job" don't get—y'know—giant awards for it. Did they give you anything good at least? Like a bonus or...?
Okay okay, the plaque is kinda whatever but five hundred bucks? That's—I mean, that's actually decent. [Chuckle] What're you gonna do with it?
Groceries? Are you—no! That's celebration money! You gotta like, treat yourself or something. Get that fancy coffee maker you've been talking about forever.
Wait, what? Your boss was surprised? That's so—ugh, typical. You basically carry that entire department and they're "surprised"? Whatever, their opinion literally doesn't matter.
She—oh. Oh! So she was like, good surprised? Not bad surprised? Because that's totally different, that's actually kinda sweet that she fought for you.
Yeah but like—awkward for twenty minutes versus having actual proof you're killing it at work? I dunno, seems worth it to me. [Sigh] You're gonna put the plaque up, right?
Oh my god, you're—you're impossible! At least take a picture of it before it like, melts in there or something. Your mom's gonna wanna see it, y'know?
I—okay, yes, I forgot about dinner, but honestly, I've had like three deadlines this week and my mom's been calling me every five minutes about the surgery thing, so I'm kinda drowning here.
I know, I know we did, and I'm sorry, but you're acting like I deliberately stood you up when—[sigh]—when literally my entire life is falling apart right now. That's not exactly fair.
Okay, that's—that sucks, and I should've called, but my phone died at work and I didn't even realize what day it was until I got home. You could maybe cut me some slack here?
Come on, that's—the third time in what, two years? And one of those was when my car literally broke down. You're keeping score now? [frustrated laugh] That's great.
You're not being—okay okay, I get that you're upset, but "forgotten" is kinda dramatic. I've been there for you through everything, y'know? One bad month doesn't erase all that.
Well that's—[scoff]—that's really nice to hear. Super understanding of you while I'm dealing with my mom possibly having cancer and trying not to lose my job.
Yeah, you're right, I could've. But I was in back-to-back meetings until seven and then—I mean, honestly? I just crashed. I'm barely keeping my head above water here.
Okay but—wait, what? You never said you had stuff going on. How am I supposed to know if you don't tell me anything?
That's not—come on, that's not fair. I've been asking how you are, but you always just say "fine" and change the subject. I can't read your mind, y'know?
No, don't—don't do that. Look look, I messed up tonight, I did, but you shutting down like this isn't gonna fix anything. Can we just—I dunno, can we talk about this properly?
Wait wait wait—what? You applied? When did you even—oh my god, which program? This is huge!
Okay, um, I'm literally trying not to scream right now because—State? That's like, that's one of the best programs in the country, right? You must be freaking out!
Oh no no no, don't do that thing where you—[Sigh] where you downplay everything. This is incredible! Have you told your parents yet?
Are you... are you actually gonna go? Because like, I mean, you don't sound super excited about it, which is kinda throwing me off honestly.
Okay but—wait, "should be"? That's different from actually being excited. What's really going on? Because this is supposed to be like, your dream, right?
Oh. Oh shit, okay, so you're—you're having second thoughts? That's totally normal though! Like, big life changes are [Chuckle] terrifying, trust me.
Um, hello? They literally chose you. Out of probably hundreds of people, they picked you because—because you're brilliant, okay? You gotta know that.
No no, I really—look, remember when you helped me understand that whole neuroscience thing for my presentation? You made it sound so easy, and I was like, completely lost before.
Basic to you! Which is exactly my point. You're gonna—[Laugh] you're gonna be that annoying smart person that makes everyone else feel dumb without even trying.
Okay first of all, rude, because you have me. Second, you're gonna find your people there, I promise. The other weirdos who think analyzing brain scans is fun or whatever.
waiting for someone who's running late
[exhausted] I haven't slept more than four hours in weeks. [quieter] Between Jamie's ear infection and the overnight shifts at the diner, [deep sigh] I'm basically a walking zombie. How do you manage everything so perfectly?
[bitter] At least you have someone to not speak to. [voice breaking] Yesterday, Jamie asked why daddy never visits anymore, and I just [choked up] stood there washing dishes, pretending I didn't hear her question through my tears.
[shocked] You're trying? [softer] You never mentioned that. [frustrated growl] God, here I am complaining about no sleep when I have the one thing you actually want. Life's twisted joke, right?
[firmly] You're right, I'm sorry. [getting louder] It's just hard watching everyone's highlight reels on Facebook while I'm counting quarters for gas money. [deflated] Jamie deserves so much more than mac and cheese five nights a week.
[suspicious] Are you serious? [voice rising hopefully] Because I can't handle pity right now, but an actual job? [rushed words] That would change everything—Jamie could finally get those dance lessons she keeps asking about!
[crying softly] Thank you. [stronger] You know, Mom always said we were two sides of the same coin. [thoughtful pause] Maybe she meant we'd need each other to feel whole, not to measure our worth against.
[laughing through tears] And now look at us—still comparing portions. [more seriously] But maybe it's time we shared the plate instead. [hopeful] Your stability, my flexibility—together we might actually build something better than either life alone.
[overwhelmed] This is really happening? [steadier] After two years of drowning, I forgot what hope felt like. [soft sob] Jamie's going to flip when she sees your pool—she's been practicing holding her breath in the bathtub.
[relieved sigh] Those events sound like torture. [sarcastically] My social life consists of other exhausted moms at the laundromat. [more genuine] But at least we're honest about our disasters—there's something freeing about having nothing left to pretend about.
[determined] Then let's stop keeping score. [building energy] Your pool, my honesty, your money, my time—we'll throw it all in together. [firm] Our kids, whenever they come, will grow up knowing family means sharing everything, especially the struggles.
[professionally] Good morning! The quiet hours are 10pm to 8am, as stated in section 4B. [reassuringly] However, I believe you might be looking at section 4C, [slightly amused] which discusses the pool area restrictions from 10am to 8pm.
[patiently] The $75 fee in section 12A is only for noise violations during quiet hours. [more firmly] It's not monthly—it's per incident. [clarifying tone] Your monthly fees are just the $1,850 rent plus $25 for parking spot B-47.
[calmly] Any guest staying more than 14 consecutive days needs to be registered. [reassuring] Three nights a week is perfectly fine! [more seriously] Just fill out form G-2019 if he ever stays two weeks straight, which is available at the office.
[slightly exasperated] Sarah's referring to last year's form—we updated it. [more patiently] The $200 is refundable when you move out, and [cheerfully] it covers your key fob, pool access, and gym entry for unit 7-C.
[explanatory tone] You're correct—utilities are included up to $150 monthly. [more clearly] Section 9F explains that anything over $150 gets prorated among units. [helpfully] Last month your portion was only $12.50 extra, remember?
[firmly] Rent is always due on the 1st. [explaining] The portal shows the 3rd because that's your grace period deadline. [warning tone] After the 3rd, there's a $50 late fee, as outlined in section 2B, subsection 4.
[sympathetically] I understand it's overwhelming. [professional tone] I'll email you our tenant quick-reference guide to apartment7c@gmail.com. [more warmly] It covers all the main points in just two pages, including important dates and fees.
[cautiously] Subletting requires approval 60 days in advance, per section 15D. [more strictly] You'll need to submit form SL-2024, provide their credit check, and [sighs] they'll need to meet our 650 minimum credit score requirement.
[thoughtfully] There is a $300 expedited processing fee for rush subletting requests. [more optimistic] If you get me the paperwork by noon today, [reassuring] I might be able to push it through in 10 business days.
[patiently amused] All forms are on our tenant portal at oakwoodapts.com/tenant. [helpfully] Use your login—it's your unit number 7C and the password you created. [cheerfully] Or just stop by the office, we're open until 6pm today!
[professionally] Good afternoon, this is Sarah from PowerGrid Utilities, how can I assist you today? [warmly] I see you're calling from the account registered to—let me just pull that up for you.
[apologetically] I completely understand your frustration, sir, and I'm—I'm truly sorry about this ongoing issue. [quickly] Let me check your account history right away to see what's been happening with those meter readings.
[more reassuringly] Sir, I can see the pattern here and—yes, you're absolutely right, this shouldn't have gone on this long. [briskly] I'm escalating this immediately to our field service team, and here's what we'll do differently this time.
[decisively] Right, so—listen, I'm scheduling a priority appointment for tomorrow between 8 and 12. [faster] The technician will call you thirty minutes before arrival, and if they can't access it, they'll need to document exactly why with photos.
[quickly] Absolutely, once we get the actual reading, we'll do a full reconciliation going back four months. [confidently] Any overcharges will be credited to your account immediately, or—or we can issue a refund check if you prefer.
[efficiently] Already typing it up as we speak—you'll have that confirmation email within five minutes. [reassuringly] It'll include my direct extension, case number 78432, and the service manager's contact as backup.
[understanding] That's completely fair, and honestly, you have every right to do that. [more quietly] Between us, sometimes that's what it takes to get things moving properly around here.
[with slight humor] I prefer to call it... external motivation. [briskly] But seriously, I've flagged this as critical, and I'll personally follow up tomorrow afternoon to confirm everything went smoothly.
[confidently] You won't need to, I promise you that. [quickly] I'm also adding a note for monthly manual reads for the next three months, just to ensure this never happens again.
[warmly] Thank you, sir—I've been doing this for eight years, and trust me, I've seen it all. [reassuringly] Your email confirmation just went through; check your inbox and let me know if you need anything else.
[Shout] No way, no way, NO WAY! [Fast] He was the killer the whole time and I just—I literally called this in episode two!
[Slow] So you're telling me... she's been dead for, like, three seasons? [Whisper] That's actually kind of brilliant.
[Disappointed] I mean, time travel, really? [Sigh] They couldn't come up with anything more original than that?
[Happy] Oh my god, they're siblings! [Laugh] I totally shipped them earlier and now I'm, uh, I'm feeling pretty weird about that.
[Sarcastic] Wow, the butler did it. [Tsk] How incredibly unexpected and not at all cliché.
[Angry] Are you kidding me right now? [Fast] Six years of watching this show and they just—they literally just erased everything!
[Whisper] Wait, wait, go back. [Slow] Did he just say what I think he said about her mother?
[Sad] I can't believe they actually killed him off like that—I mean, he was basically the heart of the whole series. [Sigh]
[Chuckle] Okay so the dog was actually, um, was actually an alien this whole time? [Happy] That's so stupid it's kinda genius!
[Fast] Hold up, hold up—if she's from the future then how did she—actually, y'know what, I don't even care anymore. [Groan]
[Disappointed] The whole thing was a dream? [Angry] I wasted forty hours of my life for "it was all a dream"?
[Slow] I'm gonna need to, like, rewatch everything now because this changes literally every single interaction they had. [Tsk]
[Sarcastic] Oh great, another secret twin plot twist. [Chuckle] What's next, evil clones?
[Whisper] Did anyone else see that coming or am I just really, really bad at picking up clues? [Sad]
[Happy] YES! I KNEW IT! [Shout] My theory was right and everyone said I was reading too much into things! [Laugh]
[Fast] Okay but wait—if he knew all along then why didn't he just—ugh, this makes no sense whatsoever. [Disappointed]
[Angry] They brought her back from the dead? [Sigh] Death means absolutely nothing in this show anymore, does it?
[Slow] That's... actually heartbreaking when you think about it. [Sad] He basically sacrificed everything for nothing.
[Chuckle] The narrator was unreliable this whole time and I fell for it like a complete idiot. [Happy] Honestly, respect.
[Whisper] So the good guys were actually—I mean, they weren't really the good guys at all, were they? [Slow] Kinda makes you think.
Frustrated about a rainy wedding, then the venue looks magical with the rain
Wait wait wait—what? You got—oh my god, are you serious? That's like, that's incredible! I mean, finally, right? They've been making you wait forever for this.
Senior analyst! Okay okay, we're definitely—we're celebrating this weekend, no arguments. How do you feel though? Like, honestly?
Fine? You're gonna give me "fine"? [Laugh] Come on, this is huge! Did they like, did they tell you why now? What changed?
Oh. Oh wait, so it's not—I mean, it's still good though, right? Like regardless of why, you're moving up and that's... that's what matters?
You don't sound—okay, what's really going on? Because like, I dunno, most people would be kinda more excited about a promotion? [Sigh] Talk to me.
Ah. Yeah, no no no, I get it now. It's like—you wanted out, not up, right? That's totally valid, honestly.
Have you been—actually wait, have you been applying other places? Because I remember you were gonna update your resume like, what, two months ago?
Right, of course not. They work you like—ugh, it's ridiculous. But okay, real talk though, is the money at least good? Like significantly better?
Twenty percent is—that's actually really solid! You could like, you could save that extra and then figure out your next move without the pressure, y'know? [Chuckle] Silver lining?
Good. That's—that's smart. And hey, "Senior Analyst" looks pretty great on that resume you're definitely gonna update soon, right? I'm just saying.
Wait, what? I—okay, I know how that sounds but it wasn't like I meant to tell anyone. We were all at lunch and Mark was going on about his interview and it just... slipped out.
Yeah, it did. I'm not gonna stand here and lie to you. But come on, you know I didn't wake up this morning planning to spill your business to the whole office.
Okay okay, I get that you're pissed. [Sigh] But honestly? You're acting like I did this to sabotage you or something. It was literally just a stupid mistake—I was trying to relate to Mark's situation and I—
I know that! God, I know that. But you're being kinda unfair here. Like, I've had your back for three years, covered for you a million times, and one screw-up means I'm suddenly the worst friend ever?
No, it wasn't, you're right. But I mean—look look, I'm sorry it happened, okay? I am. But I'm also getting a little frustrated that you won't even [scoff] let me explain or anything. Just standing there all cold and judgy.
That's—wow, that's really reductive. You know what? Fine. Be mad. But don't pretend like you've never accidentally said something you shouldn't have. Remember when you told Jake about my thing with HR?
How? How was it different? Because it was you? Look, I'm trying to apologize here but I'm not gonna grovel when you're being this—I dunno, this sanctimonious about it.
And I didn't mean to! Jesus, how many times do I have to—[frustrated laugh] You know what? I messed up. Fine fine, I own that. But you standing there acting like I'm not even worth talking to? That hurts too, y'know?
Okay, that's—that's actually pretty harsh. I said something by accident in a conversation. You're deliberately trying to make me feel like garbage right now. There's a difference.
Yeah, there is. And if you can't see that, then maybe—I dunno, maybe we've got bigger problems than me accidentally mentioning your promotion thing. Because friends are supposed to at least try to understand each other, not just... whatever this is.
Oh—oh no, that's never good. Um, did I do something? Wait, obviously I did something or you wouldn't be—sorry, I'm just trying to figure out what's going on.
No no no, please don't—don't do that. Just tell me what's wrong. I can't fix it if I don't know what I did, right? And I really wanna fix whatever this is because you seem really upset.
You are! You totally are, and I'm so grateful for that, like you have no idea how much—wait. [nervous laugh] Is this about me being needy? Because I know I can be a lot sometimes.
I—that's not—I do ask! Don't I? Oh god, I don't, do I? I mean, I think about it all the time but maybe I just—maybe I never actually say it out loud? Shit.
I know, I know, it's been a really bad week and you've been—you've been amazing, honestly. But hold on, are you saying I never check on you? Because that can't be right. Can it? [groan] Oh my god, it is.
You—what? When? Why didn't you tell me? I would've—actually no, that's literally the whole point, isn't it? You shouldn't have to tell me. I should've just known to ask.
Oh god. Oh god, I did. I was freaking out about whether oat milk was pretentious and you were—you were having a panic attack? I'm the worst friend ever, aren't I? Like genuinely the absolute worst.
I'm so—I'm so sorry. That's not even enough but I don't know what else to say. You're always taking care of me and I just—I get so wrapped up in my own head that I forget other people have stuff too, y'know?
No, you're right to be mad. Like, completely right. I've been treating you like my personal therapist instead of my friend and that's—that's really messed up. [sigh] I wanna do better. I need to do better. Will you let me try?
I know. God, of course you are. Can I—would it be okay if I listened this time? Like actually listened? No interrupting, no making it about me, just... how are you doing? For real?
realizing they're out of coffee
[nervously] Oh, hi Mr. Davidson! [higher pitch] I was just finishing up the quarterly reports. [clearing throat] Did you need something before I head out? I'm happy to stay a bit longer if there's anything urgent that needs attention today.
[strained cheerfulness] The whole weekend? [nervous laugh] Sure, I mean, I did have some plans but... [trailing off] work comes first, right? I'll just reschedule my sister's birthday dinner. She'll understand that these things happen sometimes in our industry.
[hesitant] Pop more, absolutely. [forced enthusiasm] I'll add some animations and maybe restructure the whole flow? [quieter] Though I should mention my laptop's been crashing lately. But I'm sure it'll hold up through the weekend work sessions somehow.
[exhausted whisper] Right, dedication. [trying to sound upbeat] I'll grab my sleeping bag—kidding! [hollow laugh] Though I basically live here anyway, don't I? My plants at home are probably wondering if I've abandoned them permanently at this point.
[voice cracking] Two hundred pages? [Deep breath] Of course, Mr. Davidson, happy to help. [mumbling quickly] I love learning opportunities, especially ones that consume my entire existence and leave me questioning my life choices while eating vending machine dinners alone.
[defeated] Every few hours, got it. [sarcastic undertone] I'll make sure to time my mental breakdowns between your updates. [perking up falsely] Actually, would you prefer hourly updates instead? I want to make sure you're fully informed throughout the process.
[barely audible] Fifty slides. [hysterical giggle] Why not make it a hundred while we're at it? [getting louder] I mean, I'm already sacrificing my weekend, my sanity, and my vitamin D levels for this wonderful opportunity to excel!
[voice breaking] Next weekend too? [shaky laugh] Mr. Davidson, you're so funny! [desperately cheerful] I actually love that my calendar is just work, work, work, and more work. Who needs a personal life when spreadsheets love you unconditionally, right?
[high-pitched] Train the intern! [Nervous giggle] From here! While doing everything else! [frantically upbeat] Absolutely, I'm basically a superhuman multitasking machine who doesn't need sleep, food, or basic human connection to function at peak performance levels!
[deliriously happy] Six AM meeting after my weekend here! [manic giggle] I'll get the fancy Colombian roast that costs my hourly wage! [sing-song voice] Because nothing says "valued employee" like being a barista-analyst-designer-trainer hybrid who never leaves the building!
[professional] Congratulations on your win, sir. [reassuringly] Let me pull up your file here... [pause] Yes, I see your claim for the $2.8 million prize from October 15th at the Riverside Avenue location.
[patiently] Sir, the $2.8 million represents the annuity value over 29 years. [more clearly] Your lump sum cash option, which you selected, comes to $1,680,000 before federal withholding of 24% and state taxes of 8.82%.
[sympathetically] I understand your frustration, Mr... [pause] Thompson, is it? [more formally] The withholdings are automatic—we're required by law to send $403,200 directly to the IRS and $148,176 to the state revenue department.
[calmly] The withholdings were processed when you claimed your prize on October 22nd. [helpfully] However, depending on your total income and deductions, you might receive some back when filing your 2024 tax return. [pause] Have you spoken with a tax professional yet?
[accommodating] Absolutely, I can email you Form W-2G and the withholding statements to... [checking] Is your email still robert.thompson.1975@email.com? [more cheerfully] You should receive those documents within 24 hours, reference number LC-2024-10-8847 for your records.
[gently] Sir, you're still receiving over one million dollars after taxes. [encouragingly] That's a life-changing amount of money, even if it's not the full advertised jackpot. [pause] Many winners find financial planning services helpful for managing their windfall responsibly.
[understanding] That's a common reaction, Mr. Thompson. [informatively] If it helps, you can reduce next year's tax burden by making charitable contributions or maxing out retirement contributions to your 401k—[pause] the limit for 2024 is $23,000, or $30,500 if you're over 50.
[encouragingly] Exactly, and if your spouse works, she can contribute the same amount to her plan. [helpfully] Between that and mortgage interest deductions on your Riverside property, [pause] you might see a significant refund when you file.
[reassuringly] No more surprises from our end—everything's been processed. [more formally] Your net payout of $1,128,624 was direct deposited to your Chase account ending in 7792 on October 24th. [pause] The funds should have cleared by now.
[warmly] That's wonderful perspective, Mr. Thompson. [cheerfully] Enjoy your winnings, and don't forget—that documentation with reference number LC-2024-10-8847 will arrive shortly. [sincerely] Congratulations again, and thank you for calling the State Lottery Commission!
[concerned] Mr. Harrison, I understand your frustration about the lack of updates. [apologetically] We've been, um, experiencing some internal delays with case reviews lately. [quickly] Let me pull up your file right now to see exactly where things stand.
[calmly] You're absolutely right to be upset. [more firmly] The partner assigned to your case should have contacted you weeks ago. [briskly] I'm escalating this immediately to our managing attorney, and you'll hear from someone within twenty-four hours, guaranteed.
[defensive] Sir, I can assure you we do communicate, but [more apologetically] clearly something fell through the cracks with your case. [rapidly] I'm personally taking ownership of this—not passing it off—and will follow up myself tomorrow morning.
[quickly] Yes, I can see here that your documents were reviewed on... [pause] [quieter] October 15th. [more confidently] The analysis is actually complete; it just hasn't been communicated to you, which is unacceptable on our part.
[embarrassed] I genuinely don't have a good answer for that. [briskly] What I can do is email you the preliminary findings right now—this minute—while we're on the phone. [reassuringly] Then schedule a proper consultation for tomorrow to discuss strategy.
[determined] I'm sending you a calendar invite right now with a written commitment. [quickly] If the attorney doesn't show, you'll receive a fifty percent discount on your next invoice. [confidently] That's how serious I am about fixing this.
[understanding] That's completely fair, Mr. Harrison. [rapidly] The documents should be hitting your inbox in about thirty seconds. [earnestly] We value your business, and I'm sorry we've failed to show that until now.
[assuredly] You'll be meeting with Jennifer Walsh, our senior tax attorney. [more enthusiastically] She literally wrote the book on IRS negotiations—well, a book anyway. [briskly] She's already reviewing your case as we speak.
[quickly] Two PM sharp, and she's blocking ninety minutes just for you. [firmly] I've also added myself as a backup contact, so if anything changes—which it won't—you'll know immediately. [reassuringly] We're getting this back on track.
[warmly] No apology necessary—you had every right to be upset. [sincerely] We dropped the ball, plain and simple. [briskly] Tomorrow at two, Jennifer will have a complete action plan ready for your review.
[Slow] Every single time I've ignored that little voice in my head, I've, um, I've regretted it. [Sigh] Every time.
[Happy] Look, my gut literally saved me from taking that job—turns out the company went under like three months later! [Laugh]
[Fast] [Angry] People keep telling me I need "evidence" and "logic" but y'know what? My instincts have never—and I mean never—been wrong about someone being sketchy.
[Whisper] It's kinda hard to explain, but I just... I feel things before they happen sometimes. [Slow] Like this weird energy shift, you know?
[Sarcastic] Oh sure, I should totally ignore millions of years of evolution that gave us these survival instincts—what could possibly go wrong? [Tsk]
[Disappointed] I used to second-guess myself constantly, but then I realized—wait, why am I trusting everyone else more than myself? [Sigh]
My body literally tenses up when something's off—like, uh, like right now actually, and I'm gonna listen to it.
[Shout] That feeling in my stomach has saved my life before! [Fast] I'm not being dramatic—I mean literally saved my life!
[Sad] [Slow] The one time I didn't trust myself was when... when I lost everything that mattered, so yeah.
[Chuckle] Call it whatever you want—intuition, sixth sense, spidey sense—but mine's basically never let me down.
[Fast] Okay so basically our brains process like thousands of tiny details we don't even consciously notice, right? [Happy] That's what instincts are!
[Angry] [Groan] I'm so tired of people telling me I'm being "irrational" when my gut feelings keep being proven right!
You ever just walk into a room and immediately know you gotta get out? [Whisper] That's happened to me twice, and both times—yeah.
[Sarcastic] [Slow] Sure, let me just ignore this screaming alarm bell in my head because someone else thinks they know better.
[Disappointed] I dunno, maybe I'm weird, but I can literally feel when someone's lying to me—it's like this, this buzzing sensation. [Tsk]
[Happy] [Fast] My therapist actually told me that trusting your instincts is, like, super important for mental health—so I'm totally validated here!
[Sad] After what happened with my ex, I promised myself I'd never—absolutely never—ignore those red flag feelings again. [Sigh]
[Shout] Why would I not trust the thing that's kept humans alive for thousands of years? [Laugh] [Fast] That's just basic survival, people!
Honestly? [Slow] [Whisper] Sometimes I know things I shouldn't know, and I've just... I've learned to accept that and go with it.
[Chuckle] My mom always said I had "the gift"—which sounds dramatic but, um, she wasn't wrong about my track record here.
Calmly describing a spot on the ceiling they noticed, then looking closer, then seeing it's moving and it's bugs, ending in infestation realization horror
I—okay, yes, technically I knew, but I didn't think he'd actually show up? Like, he said maybe, and you know how he is with maybes, they're usually nos, so I just assumed—
Wait wait wait, that came out wrong. I mean, I should've told you, obviously I should've told you. I just—everything happened so fast and then we were already there and I kept trying to find the right moment to pull you aside but—[nervous laugh] god, I'm making this worse, aren't I?
I know. I know, and that was—that was horrible. I saw your face when you walked in and I just... I wanted to die, honestly. Like literally wanted the floor to open up and swallow me whole because I realized how badly I'd messed up.
No no no, not three weeks—okay, maybe like... two and a half? But I didn't know know, y'know? People were just talking and I didn't wanna spread rumors or make you upset over nothing if it wasn't even true—
That's not—[sigh] okay, yeah. Yeah, that's exactly what I did. I thought I was protecting you but I wasn't, I was just... being a coward, I guess. I didn't wanna be the one to tell you because I knew it would hurt and I just—I'm so sorry.
No! No, you didn't, I promise you didn't. Everyone was on your side, literally everyone thought he was being a complete ass for bringing her there. And honestly? You handled it way better than I would've—I would've probably cried or thrown something or both.
Would've been justified, honestly. Like completely, one hundred percent justified. [groan] I should've—as soon as I heard he might be there, I should've texted you. Or called. Or literally sent a carrier pigeon, anything except just... hoping it would work out somehow.
I know. And I—I do have your back, I swear I do, I just... I handled this completely wrong. Like catastrophically wrong. I kept telling myself I was waiting for the right time but really I was just—I dunno, scared? Which is such a stupid excuse because you're my best friend and you deserved to know.
Can I—can I make it up to you? Somehow? I mean, I know I can't undo it, but... maybe we could go get terrible ice cream and plot revenge or something? I'll even let you pick the most embarrassing photo of me to post if you want. The one from Halloween with the—y'know.
[nervous laugh] Oh god, yeah, even that one. I mean, I'll hate it, but I kinda deserve some public humiliation right now. Just—please don't stay mad forever? I really am sorry. Like, genuinely, deeply, groveling-on-my-knees sorry.
Oh! Um, okay—wait, is this about last night? Because I can explain, I really didn't mean to—I know I was being kinda pushy but I just thought you two would be so perfect together, y'know?
No no no, you're right, I'm sorry. I just—I get excited sometimes and I don't think about how it might make you feel. [nervous laugh] Which is like, really selfish of me, I know.
I know! God, I know, and I—honestly I don't even realize I'm doing it half the time? That's not an excuse though, I'm not trying to make excuses. I just genuinely think you'd be happy if you gave him a chance—sorry! Sorry, I'm doing it again.
You did. You absolutely did, and I just—I kept ignoring that, didn't I? [sigh] I'm like one of those awful people who thinks they know better than everyone else about their own lives.
Okay, I deserve that. Totally deserve that. I've been treating you like you don't know what you want, which is so—that's so disrespectful, oh my god. I'm literally the worst friend.
You're right, you're—you're completely right. I've been making everything about my little matchmaking project instead of just, like, enjoying time with you? That's messed up. That's really, really messed up of me.
Wait, really? Oh god, I—[groan] I didn't realize it was that bad. I mean, obviously it was bad, but I didn't know I was actually pushing you away. That's like, the opposite of what I wanted.
I dunno, I guess I just—I wanted you to be happy? You've been kinda down lately and I thought maybe—but that's so stupid, right? Like dating someone isn't gonna magically fix everything. And you never even asked for my help.
I'm gonna stop. Like, completely stop, I promise. No more bringing up Ryan, no more "accidental" run-ins, no more—god, I've been so annoying, haven't I? I'm surprised you didn't tell me off sooner. [quieter] I'm really, truly sorry.
You have me. You—you always had me, I just got way too caught up in this stupid idea and I... yeah. I'm done with it. Completely done. Can we maybe, um, start over? Like just be normal friends who don't make everything about some guy you're not even interested in?
Oh god, okay—I can explain. I didn't tell everyone, I swear, it was just—I mentioned it to like two people and then somehow it just... spread? I dunno how it happened.
I know, I know! And I'm—I'm literally the worst friend ever. It just kinda slipped out when we were talking about the whole job thing and I wasn't thinking—wait no, that's not an excuse. [nervous laugh] There is no excuse.
Oh no. Oh no no no, that's—okay that's really bad. I didn't think it would—I mean, how did she even—? Actually, doesn't matter. This is my fault. Completely, totally my fault.
You trusted me with something really personal and I just—I blew it. Like, spectacularly. I've been trying to figure out why I even opened my mouth and honestly? [sigh] I think I was just trying to make conversation and I'm an idiot who doesn't think before speaking.
No! No, it's not. I'm not—I'm not trying to make excuses, I'm just... I wanna be honest with you, y'know? About how badly I screwed up. Because I did. I really, really did.
I know. And now I've made it like a thousand times worse and I just—god, I hate myself for this. You were already going through so much and I just piled on more crap. That's not—that's not what friends do.
Is there any way I can—wait, that's stupid, I can't undo it. But like, going forward? What do you need from me? Space? Should I try to do damage control? I'll literally do whatever you want. [groan] I just wanna fix this somehow.
You're right. You're totally right. I just—I keep thinking about how you must've felt when people started asking you about it and I... I feel sick about it, honestly. Like physically sick.
I deserve that. I do. Um, for what it's worth—which is probably nothing right now—but you're gonna bounce back from this, y'know? The job thing, I mean. You're literally the smartest, most capable person I know and this one thing doesn't—doesn't define you.
I won't. I swear I won't. And I'm gonna—I'm gonna work really hard to earn your trust back, if you'll let me. However long it takes. Because you mean... you mean everything to me and I'm so, so sorry I hurt you.
I—okay, yeah, I know how it looks. But it's not that I didn't trust you, I swear, it's just—I didn't know how to bring it up? Like every time I tried to tell you, something would come up or I'd just... chicken out.
No no no, wait—please don't do that. Don't shut down on me. I wanted to tell you so many times, honestly, but it got harder the longer I waited and then—[nervous laugh] then it became this whole thing where I'd waited too long, y'know?
Oh god. Oh god, she told you? I specifically asked her not to—okay, that's not the point. You're right, you shouldn't have found out that way. That's... that's literally the worst way you could've found out.
No! No, absolutely not. Just my parents and—um, well, my therapist, obviously. But that's it. I didn't tell anyone else, I promise. You're actually the person I wanted to tell most, I just... I dunno, I kept messing it up.
That's not—[sigh] okay, I see how it sounds. But the anxiety stuff, it got really bad, like really really bad, and I needed professional help. It wasn't about not trusting you, it was about me being a complete mess and not wanting to burden you with it.
I know I know, that's stupid, but you were dealing with your job stuff and your dad's surgery and I just—I thought I was protecting you? Which sounds so dumb now that I'm saying it out loud. God, I'm such an idiot.
I deserve that. I really—I really messed this up, didn't I? Like, we've been friends for eight years and I just... I got so stuck in my own head about it. I kept thinking I was doing the right thing by handling it myself but I wasn't. [quieter] I really wasn't.
No, that's—that's not what I thought at all. I knew you could handle it, of course you could, you're literally the strongest person I know. I was the one who couldn't handle telling you. I was scared you'd—I dunno, worry too much? Try to fix everything? And I already felt so broken.
You're right. You're completely right and I'm—god, I'm so sorry. Like genuinely, deeply sorry. I should've trusted you with this, I should've let you in instead of just... shutting down and pretending everything was fine. That wasn't fair to you. To us.
Yeah, I am. The meds are helping and therapy is—it's good, actually. Really good. And I wanna—if you're willing, I wanna be honest with you about all of it now. No more hiding stuff, I promise. I just... I really need my best friend back. [pause] If you'll still have me.
trying to figure out the serving size on a nutrition label
[breathless] I can't—I can't believe the soap actually melted through! [hysterical giggling] Three months of collecting bars from the commissary, [louder] and it WORKED! The drain cover just... dissolved like butter!
[whispered excitement] We're actually out. [building volume] We're standing in a field, Marcus! [explosive laughter] Not concrete, not bars—GRASS! I haven't touched grass in four years!
[shrieking] The warden's toupee! [more controlled] Remember when it flew off during inspection? [snorting laugh] That's when I knew—if he couldn't keep his hair on, he couldn't keep us in!
[mock serious] "Inmates Johnson and Marcus, report for morning count." [breaking into laughter] They're counting empty beds right now! [gleeful shout] By tomorrow we'll be in Mexico eating tacos!
[choked up] We did it, man. [stronger] After all their "maximum security" talk, their cameras, their dogs. [triumphant laugh] Two guys with soap and spoons beat their million-dollar system!
[hushed urgency] Wait, wait—do you hear that? [relieved exhale] Just a rabbit! [hysterical] I thought it was bloodhounds! A rabbit! I'm scared of woodland creatures now!
[philosophical tone] You know what's crazy? [speeding up excitedly] We complained about the meatloaf every Tuesday for three years. [wistful laugh] I'd kill for that garbage meatloaf right now!
[shaky whisper] My legs are jello. [getting stronger] Adrenaline's wearing off and I can barely stand. [giddy laughter] But I'd crawl to Canada if it meant staying free!
