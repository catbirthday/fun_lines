You are B; your role: Character 2

Character 1: So. They accepted my piece for the show.
88 Character 2: Wait wait wait—what? The gallery thing? The one you were like, totally convinced you had no shot at? Oh my god, are you serious right now?
Character 1: Yeah. Got the email this morning.
89 Character 2: I'm—okay I'm literally gonna cry. This is huge! Like, this is the same place that had that whole retrospective last year, right? The one we went to and you were all—[Gasp] oh my god, which piece did they take?
Character 1: The big one. With the hands.
90 Character 2: The hands one? That's—that's perfect actually. I mean, obviously they'd pick that one, it's like... haunting? But also kinda beautiful? I dunno how you do that.
Character 1: It's just paint.
91 Character 2: No no no, don't—don't do that thing where you minimize it. This is literally what you've been working towards for like, what, three years? Four? You gotta let yourself feel good about this.
Character 1: I don't know. What if people hate it?
92 Character 2: Okay but like—even if they do, which they won't, but even if they did... you're in a gallery show. That's—[Chuckle] sorry but that's more than most people ever get, y'know?
Character 1: I guess. Opening night's in two weeks.
93 Character 2: Two weeks? Oh god, okay, we need to—do you have something to wear? Actually wait, more importantly, are you gonna invite your parents? Because I remember last time you were all weird about—
Character 1: Haven't decided.
94 Character 2: Right, yeah, that's—that's fair. I mean, it's complicated with them and the whole art thing. But um, just so you know? I'm definitely coming. Like, try and stop me.
Character 1: You don't have to make a big deal about it.
95 Character 2: Are you kidding? My best friend's gonna have their art in an actual gallery with like, those little cards with your name on them and everything. I'm gonna be insufferable about it, honestly. [Laugh]
Character 1: Great. Can't wait.
96 Character 2: Oh please, you love it. But seriously though—how are you actually feeling? Because I know you, and you're probably like, freaking out internally while acting all cool about it.
Character 1: It doesn't feel real yet.
97 Character 2: Yeah, I—I totally get that. But it is real, okay? You did this. And I'm just... I'm really, really proud of you. Even if you're gonna be all weird about me saying that.

Character 1: You didn't show up.
98 Character 2: I know, I know—look, before you say anything else, I had a really bad panic attack, okay? Like, I literally couldn't breathe, couldn't leave my apartment. It wasn't about you or your party.
Character 1: You could've texted.
99 Character 2: I was—I mean, I was kinda busy trying not to die? That's not fair. You're acting like I just decided to blow you off for fun when I was literally [sharp exhale] on my bathroom floor.
Character 1: Everyone asked where you were.
100 Character 2: And I'm sorry about that, I am, but like—what do you want me to say? That I should've just powered through it? Come on. You know that's not how panic attacks work.
Character 1: I don't know. You tell me how they work.
101 Character 2: Okay, that's—wow. That's really shitty actually. I get that you're mad but you're being kinda cruel right now. I didn't choose this.
Character 1: You chose not to tell me until now.
102 Character 2: Because I knew you'd react like—like this! You're proving my point. I'm trying to explain what happened and you're just... [scoff] you're not even listening.
Character 1: I'm listening. Keep talking.
103 Character 2: No, you're not, you're—you're waiting for me to apologize more. And fine, fine, I'm sorry I missed your party, but I'm not gonna apologize for having a mental health crisis.
Character 1: That's convenient.
104 Character 2: Are you seriously—okay, you know what? Fuck this. I thought you'd at least try to understand, but you're too busy being hurt to give a shit about what I went through.
Character 1: I planned this for months.
105 Character 2: I know that! I know, okay? And I wanted to be there, I really really did. But my brain didn't—it just didn't cooperate. That doesn't mean I don't care about you.
Character 1: Feels like it.
106 Character 2: Well that's—that's on you then. Because I've shown up for you a hundred times before this. One time, one time I couldn't make it, and suddenly I'm the worst friend ever?
Character 1: Not the worst. Just disappointing.
107 Character 2: Yeah well [frustrated laugh] join the club I guess. I'm pretty disappointed too—in both of us. This isn't—this isn't who we're supposed to be to each other, y'know?

You are Character (A); your role: Character 1

--- FULL SCRIPT ---
109 Character 1: [cheerfully] Sweetie, I've reorganized your entire apartment while you were at work! [getting faster] I color-coded your closet, meal-prepped for two weeks, and [giggling] even scheduled your dentist appointment for tomorrow at nine.
Character 2: [stunned] Mom, you... you broke into my apartment? [voice rising] I gave you that key for emergencies only. [firmly] This isn't okay—I'm twenty-eight years old and perfectly capable of managing my own life.
110 Character 1: [wounded] But darling, I was just trying to help! [quivering] The place was such a mess, and you never answer my calls anymore. [Soft sob] I worry about you constantly since you moved out.
Character 2: [exhausted sigh] I don't answer because you call fifteen times a day. [steadier] Look, I love you, but [pause] I need you to respect my space. These surprise visits have to stop immediately.
111 Character 1: [frantically] Fifteen times isn't that much when you think about it! [defensive] Your father thinks I'm being perfectly reasonable. [pleading whisper] Can't a mother just check if her baby ate breakfast and took vitamins?
Character 2: [controlled anger] Dad asked me to talk to you about this, actually. [slower] He said you've been sleeping in my old room, [shakily] crying over my baby photos every single night for months.
112 Character 1: [accusingly] Well, someone has to remember when you were sweet! [bitter laugh] Now you act like I'm some kind of burden. [dramatically] I gave up everything for you, my entire career, my whole identity!
Character 2: [gently] Mom, I never asked you to give up anything. [more firmly] You made those choices yourself. [Deep breath] Maybe it's time you found something new to focus on—a hobby, volunteering, literally anything else.
113 Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh, wonderful advice from someone who can't even fold fitted sheets properly! [getting louder] You still need me, whether you admit it or not. [Nervous giggle] Who else would notice you're dating that terrible person?
Character 2: [shocked] You've been following me on dates? [voice cracking] Mom, that's stalking. [determined whisper] I'm changing my locks tomorrow, and if you don't respect these boundaries, we'll need to take a real break.
114 Character 1: [hysterically] A break? From your own mother? [Choking sob] This is exactly what happened with cousin Janet and look how that turned out! [whimpering] She died alone, probably calling for her ungrateful children!
Character 2: [calmly] Janet died peacefully surrounded by family who visited on healthy terms. [pause] Mom, I'm not abandoning you. [reassuringly] I'm asking for normal adult boundaries—weekly dinners, planned visits, maybe one daily text exchange.
115 Character 1: [desperately] But what if there's an emergency and I can't reach you immediately? [rapid words] What if you choke on dinner, or slip in the shower, or [Gasp] get kidnapped by internet people?
Character 2: [slight laugh] The internet people aren't coming for me, Mom. [seriously] Listen, I know empty nest is hard. [softer] Would you consider talking to someone professional about this anxiety you're experiencing lately?
116 Character 1: [offended whisper] You think I'm crazy now? [building volume] First I'm a stalker, now I need therapy? [Bitter chuckle] Maybe I should just pretend you don't exist like those modern parents do!
Character 2: [firmly] That's manipulative and you know it. [measured tone] Therapy isn't punishment—it's support during life transitions. [warmly] Dad mentioned you used to love painting; why not take that watercolor class at the community center?
117 Character 1: [quietly] You and your father have been discussing me behind my back? [hurt] I suppose everyone thinks poor Mom is just pathetic now. [Shaky breath] Fine, maybe I have been a tiny bit overwhelming.
Character 2: [relieved] Thank you for hearing me. [lovingly] Mom, you're not pathetic—you're just lost without your main job. [hopefully] Being my parent doesn't end, but the role has to evolve now.
118 Character 1: [reluctantly] I suppose calling three times daily would be excessive too? [Nervous laugh] The watercolor class does meet Tuesdays and Thursdays. [thoughtfully] Margaret from book club mentioned she's taking it; maybe I could actually join her.
Character 2: [warmly] That sounds perfect, and I'd love to see your paintings. [enthusiastically] How about Sunday dinners at your place? [tenderly] I'll even bring dessert—but Mom, you have to promise to return my apartment key.

119 Character 1: [firmly] Dr. Martinez, I need to discuss a serious breach of professional boundaries involving my therapist, Dr. Sarah Chen—license number 47B-2019. [pause] She friended me on Facebook last Tuesday, May 14th, and [voice rising] has been commenting on all my personal posts.

Customer Support: D2: [concerned] I understand this must be very uncomfortable for you. [reassuring tone] Let me pull up Dr. Chen's file—case number 892-XY—and we'll document this properly. [more seriously] Can you tell me, um, when exactly did you first notice these interactions?
120 Character 1: [frustrated] It started innocently enough with a friend request around 9:30 PM, but then—[sighs heavily]—she liked seventeen photos from my 2018 vacation. [incredulous] She even commented "Looking great!" on my beach photos, which felt... invasive.

Customer Support: D4: [professionally] This is absolutely inappropriate behavior that violates Section 5.06 of our ethical guidelines. [pause] [more gently] I need to ask—have there been any other boundary crossings during your sessions at our 4521 Maple Street location?
121 Character 1: [hesitant] Well, during our last three sessions she kept mentioning her divorce proceedings. [voice breaking] She spent maybe 20 minutes—20 minutes!—of my $175 session talking about her ex-husband Gary. [sarcastically] Really therapeutic for ME, you know?

Customer Support: D6: [apologetically] I'm so sorry you've experienced this unprofessional conduct. [more firmly] These violations—both the social media contact and the self-disclosure—require immediate intervention. [carefully] Have you, uh, responded to any of her online communications?
122 Character 1: [defensively] I blocked her immediately after she sent me a private message at 11:47 PM asking if I wanted to grab coffee! [groans] My anxiety is through the roof—isn't she supposed to be helping with that?

Customer Support: D8: [shocked] A social invitation outside of therapy is a severe violation of protocol 7-A in our handbook. [reassuring] We're going to file a formal complaint with report number QM-2024-0892 today. [more softly] How are you managing emotionally with all of this?
123 Character 1: [upset] Honestly? I feel betrayed and—[voice shaking]—I don't know if I can trust another therapist here. [bitterly] I've been coming to this clinic since 2021, and now I'm considering filing with the state board, license complaint form 45-C.

Customer Support: D10: [empathetically] Your feelings are completely valid, and you have every right to file that complaint. [determined tone] I'm suspending Dr. Chen effective immediately, pending investigation code R-77. [warmly] Would you like me to personally match you with a new therapist who specializes in, um, boundary-respectful treatment?
124 Character 1: [skeptically] How do I know this won't happen again with therapist number—what would this be—four? [sighs] I specifically requested someone experienced when I filled out intake form 12-B, and look where that got me.

Customer Support: D12: [confidently] I personally supervise Dr. James Wong, license 51A-2020, who has zero complaints in five years. [reassuring] He's available Thursdays at 2:00 PM in suite 203, and I'll monitor your case myself. [more seriously] Would that provide enough oversight for you?
125 Character 1: [considering] Dr. Wong... I've heard good things about him from the support group that meets Wednesdays. [cautiously hopeful] If you're personally guaranteeing oversight with your supervisor license—SV-8823, right?—then maybe I'll give it one more try.

Customer Support: D14: [warmly] That's correct, SV-8823, and I stake my reputation on this. [professional tone] I'll waive your next three copays—that's $105 saved—as an apology for this experience. [sincerely] Your trust means everything to us.
126 Character 1: [relieved] Thank you for taking this seriously, unlike the office manager who said I was "overreacting" yesterday. [more firmly] I want everything documented though—every incident from May 14th through today, May 21st.

Customer Support: D16: [disapproving] The office manager dismissed your concerns? [frustrated] That's another issue we need to address—employee ID number? [determined] Everything will be in writing by 5:00 PM today, complaint reference TH-2024-521.
127 Character 1: [tired] Employee 10847—Rebecca something—she practically rolled her eyes at me. [sighs deeply] I just want to feel safe in therapy again, you know? [quietly] Is that too much to ask for my mental health investment?

Customer Support: D18: [firmly] Absolutely not too much to ask—it's the bare minimum we owe you. [compassionate] Rebecca from reception will be retrained immediately on complaint protocols. [reassuring tone] Your new intake with Dr. Wong is scheduled for May 28th at 2:00 PM.
128 Character 1: [gratefully] I appreciate you listening and actually doing something about this mess. [pause] [cautiously] Will Dr. Chen still have access to my files—all those notes from our 23 sessions?

Customer Support: D20: [decisively] Her access was revoked at 10:32 AM this morning—security protocol 9-Delta activated immediately. [gentle but firm] Only Dr. Wong and I will have file access, authorization code PM-447. [warmly] We're going to make this right for you, I promise.

129 Customer Support: [briskly] Alright, let's check your water softener settings real quick. [confidently] Your hardness should be set to match your water test results—what number did you get, [quickly] somewhere between 7 and 25 grains?
Character 1: [confused] I... I don't know what grains are? [nervously] The manual says something about, um, regeneration cycles and [pause] salt dosage, but [frustrated sigh] none of this makes any sense to me.
130 Customer Support: [reassuringly] No worries, grains just measure how hard your water is. [more quickly] Did you get a test kit with the unit, or—actually, let me ask—[direct] when you run water, do you see white spots on dishes?
Character 1: [exasperated] White spots? [louder] Everything has white spots! [groans] My shower door looks frosted, my faucets are crusty, and [desperately] I've been adding salt every week but nothing's changing.
131 Customer Support: [concerned] Every week? [sharp intake] That's way too much salt—you're probably stuck in constant regeneration. [rapidly] Quick question: what's your capacity setting showing, and [more urgently] is the time display blinking or solid?
Character 1: [hesitant] The display shows... twelve hundred something? [slowly] And there's definitely blinking, like, [frustrated] three different numbers that keep changing. [defeated] Should I just call a plumber instead?
132 Customer Support: [quickly] No, no, we can fix this right now. [determined] That twelve hundred is your capacity—totally wrong for residential use. [instructive tone] Press and hold the up arrow, [more slowly] then tap down twice when it beeps.
Character 1: [skeptical] Okay, pressing up... [surprised] Oh! It beeped really loud. [uncertainly] Now it says "HD" and a number twenty-five? [worried] Did I break it, because that seems really high?
133 Customer Support: [excited] Perfect, that's your hardness setting! [rapidly] Twenty-five is actually pretty hard water, so that explains the spots. [more patiently] Now hit next—we need to set regeneration to, um, [calculating] probably every four days for your household.
Character 1: [relieved chuckle] Four days, not every day like I had it. [embarrassed] No wonder my water bill was insane last month. [curiously] But wait, how do I know when it's actually, you know, [pause] working properly?
134 Customer Support: [professionally] You'll hear it regenerate at 2 AM—sounds like rushing water for about ninety minutes. [reassuring] The spots should disappear within a week, and [enthusiastically] your soap will get super sudsy, almost too much actually.
Character 1: [thoughtful] Two in the morning, that explains the weird noises. [laughs nervously] I thought I had ghost plumbers or something. [more seriously] So just leave it alone now, [questioning] or should I still add salt weekly?
135 Customer Support: [amused chuckle] Ghost plumbers, that's a new one. [instructively] Check salt monthly, not weekly—it should be at least [emphasizing] one-third full, but [quickly] never pack it to the top, that causes bridges.
Character 1: [confused] Bridges? [incredulous] Like actual bridges in my salt tank? [pause] I'm sorry, but [overwhelmed] every answer creates two more questions here—is there a simple guide somewhere?
136 Customer Support: [sympathetically] Salt bridges are just hardened salt chunks that block water flow. [more briskly] Look, I'll email you our quick-start guide, but [confidently] honestly, you're all set now—these settings should handle everything automatically.
Character 1: [grateful] Oh thank god, an email guide would be amazing. [hopefully] Will it explain what all these buttons do, because [sheepishly] I've been afraid to touch half of them since installation.
137 Customer Support: [chuckles warmly] Most customers never need those other buttons anyway. [reassuringly] The guide covers the basics—hardness, regeneration time, and [quickly] salt level indicators. [firmly] Don't overthink it; water softeners are simpler than they seem.
Character 1: [relieved sigh] Simpler than they seem, sure. [sarcastically] Says the person who knows what grain capacity regeneration cycles mean. [genuinely] But seriously, thanks for not making me feel stupid about this.
138 Customer Support: [kindly] Hey, nobody's born knowing water chemistry. [encouragingly] You figured out the settings faster than most people do, and [briskly] now you're good for probably years—just salt, wait, and enjoy spot-free dishes.
Character 1: [optimistic] Spot-free dishes sound like a dream. [gratefully] Thanks for talking me through this instead of just, you know, [lighter] sending me back to that horrible manual. [determined] I'm actually excited to see this thing finally work right!
