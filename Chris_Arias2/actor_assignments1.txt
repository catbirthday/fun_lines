Character 1: So I won that thing yesterday.
1 Character 2: Wait wait wait—what thing? Are you—oh my god, the dance competition? You actually went through with it?
Character 1: Yeah. First place.
2 Character 2: Shut up. Shut UP. You're telling me you just—you won? Like, the whole thing? I mean, I knew you were practicing but I didn't even know you were gonna [Gasp] actually compete!
Character 1: It wasn't a big deal.
3 Character 2: Okay no no no, we're not doing this. You literally won a dance competition and you're acting like you just, what, found five bucks on the sidewalk? This is huge!
Character 1: There were only twelve people.
4 Character 2: Only twelve—are you kidding me right now? That's still twelve people who didn't win, y'know? Like, you beat actual dancers. With your body. Moving to music. [Laugh] Sorry, I'm just—I'm processing.
Character 1: My mom cried.
5 Character 2: Of course she did! Oh my god, wait—did she film it? Please tell me someone filmed it because I'm gonna need to see this immediately. Like, right now.
Character 1: There's video. It's... not great.
6 Character 2: Um, excuse me? Not great? You won! That's literally the definition of great! What style was it—wait, let me guess. Contemporary? No no, hip-hop?
Character 1: Ballroom, actually.
7 Character 2: Ballroom? You—okay that's even more insane because that requires like, actual technique and—hold on, did you have a partner? Who was your partner?
Character 1: This woman from class. Sandra. She's sixty-three.
8 Character 2: Stop it. [Chuckle] You're telling me you and a sixty-three-year-old named Sandra just absolutely destroyed the competition? That's—that's literally the best thing I've ever heard.
Character 1: She was better than me.
9 Character 2: Okay but like, together you were obviously amazing, right? I mean, you don't just accidentally win these things. How long have you guys been practicing?
Character 1: Three months. Every Tuesday.
10 Character 2: Three months of Tuesdays and you're out here winning trophies! Wait—there was a trophy, right? Please tell me there's like, a big sparkly trophy sitting in your apartment right now.

Script: 1efd797a_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: My mom called me crying.
11 Character 2: Oh god, oh no—I didn't mean to make her cry! I was just—I was having such a bad day and she kept asking about my job situation and I kinda... snapped.
Character 1: You snapped at my mother.
12 Character 2: I know, I know how that sounds. It's just—she wouldn't stop with the questions, y'know? Like "when are you gonna get promoted" and "why don't you apply somewhere else" and I—[groan] I'm not making this better, am I?
Character 1: Not really, no.
13 Character 2: Right. Of course. I just—I told her it was none of her business, which was... that was completely out of line. Like, she was just being nice, trying to help, and I basically bit her head off.
Character 1: She was trying to help you because she cares about you.
14 Character 2: I know that! I do, I swear I know that. Your mom's literally—she's like a second mom to me, which makes this so much worse. Wait wait, let me—I already called her to apologize but she didn't pick up. [nervous laugh] Probably screening my calls now, huh?
Character 1: Can you blame her?
15 Character 2: No. No, absolutely not. I was—god, I was such a jerk. The thing is, I've been so stressed about money and my parents keep comparing me to my sister and I just... I took it out on the wrong person. That's not an excuse though, I'm not—I'm not trying to make excuses.
Character 1: You really hurt her feelings. She thinks you hate her now.
16 Character 2: What? No no no, that's—I could never hate her! She makes the best lasagna and always remembers my birthday and she—oh my god, is that really what she thinks? [quieter] I'm such an idiot.
Character 1: Yeah. You are.
17 Character 2: I gotta fix this. I mean, I don't even know how to fix this but I have to try, right? Maybe I could—should I send flowers? Or like, write a letter? I'm honestly terrible at apologies but I can't—I can't have your mom thinking I hate her.
Character 1: She doesn't need flowers. She needs a real apology.
18 Character 2: You're right, you're absolutely right. I'll—I'll go to your house tomorrow, if that's okay? Like, apologize face to face, properly. Tell her how much she means to me and that I was just being a complete ass because of my own stuff.
Character 1: Tomorrow at 2. She'll be home.
19 Character 2: Tomorrow at 2, got it. And I'll—I'll bring those cookies she likes from the bakery downtown? Not as like, a bribe or anything, just... y'know. [sigh] I really am sorry. To you too, for putting you in this position.
Character 1: Just don't make her cry again.
20 Character 2: I won't. I promise I won't. And um, thanks for—thanks for telling me how badly I messed up. I needed to hear it. Even though you're still kinda terrifying when you're mad, just so you know.

Script: b64a89c1_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: We need to talk about something.
21 Character 2: Oh god, okay—what's wrong? Did I do something? I mean, obviously I did something or you wouldn't be looking at me like that, but—
Character 1: You just did it again.
22 Character 2: Did what? I don't—wait, oh no. Oh no no no. The interrupting thing? Is this about the interrupting? Because Julie mentioned something last week and I thought she was joking but—
Character 1: Every single conversation.
23 Character 2: I know, I know! I'm sorry, I just—my brain goes so fast and I get excited and the words just kinda... fall out? [nervous laugh] That's not an excuse though, I know it's not.
Character 1: I can't finish a sentence around you anymore.
24 Character 2: That's—okay that's fair. That's totally fair. I've been trying to work on it, I swear, but it's like—honestly? Sometimes I don't even realize I'm doing it until after. Which sounds fake but it's not, I promise.
Character 1: It makes me feel like you don't care what I have to say.
25 Character 2: No! No, that's not—I care so much about what you say! I literally—that's why I get so excited and wanna respond right away because I'm interested! But I see how that's... yeah, that's actually terrible. [groan] God, I'm the worst.
Character 1: I've started just not telling you things.
26 Character 2: Wait, what? You've been—oh. Oh that's... that really hurts to hear but I—I get it. I totally get why you'd just give up trying. Um, how long has this been bothering you?
Character 1: Months. Maybe longer.
27 Character 2: Months?! And you didn't—actually no, you probably tried to tell me and I interrupted that too, didn't I? Jesus. I'm so, so sorry. Like genuinely, from the bottom of my heart sorry.
Character 1: I just want to have normal conversations with my friend.
28 Character 2: I want that too! I really—I wanna be better about this. Maybe you could like, I dunno, give me a signal when I do it? Or just straight up tell me to shut up? [sigh] I need to actually listen instead of just... waiting for my turn to talk.
Character 1: You'd be okay with me calling you out?
29 Character 2: Yes! Please! Call me out every single time, I mean it. I'd rather you do that than—than lose you as a friend because I can't keep my mouth shut, y'know?
Character 1: Okay. We can try that. But you have to actually try too.
30 Character 2: I will, I promise I will. And I'm gonna—I'm gonna practice with other people too, like really focus on it. Thank you for telling me instead of just... giving up on me completely. That means a lot.

Script: b3d8e939_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: Three weeks. You've been avoiding me for three weeks.
31 Character 2: I haven't been—okay no, that's not fair. I have been. But it's not what you think, I swear. There's just been so much going on and I didn't know how to—how to talk about it.
Character 1: So you just disappeared instead.
32 Character 2: No no no, I didn't disappear! I mean, I guess I kinda did but—[nervous laugh] god, I'm really bad at this. I wanted to tell you, I really did, but every time I tried to bring it up I just... froze.
Character 1: Tried to bring what up?
33 Character 2: It's—okay, this is gonna sound so stupid. But um, remember when we were supposed to hang out like a month ago? And I canceled last minute? That's when everything started getting weird and I just—I didn't know how to explain without sounding like a complete mess.
Character 1: You could have tried.
34 Character 2: I know! I know I could have and I should have and honestly I'm—I'm the worst friend. Like literally the worst. You deserved better than me just pulling away without any explanation.
Character 1: Yeah. I did.
35 Character 2: My therapist said I was doing this thing where I—wait, that's not how I wanted to start. [Sigh] Basically I've been dealing with some anxiety stuff and instead of talking about it like a normal person, I just... avoided everyone who matters to me.
Character 1: Your therapist?
36 Character 2: Yeah, I um—I started seeing someone. About a month ago actually. That's what I was gonna tell you but then I got all weird about it because I didn't want you to think I was like, broken or something? Which is so dumb, I know I know.
Character 1: That's what this was about? Therapy?
37 Character 2: Not just—well, kinda? It's more like... I was embarrassed? And then the longer I waited to tell you, the weirder it got, and then I was anxious about being anxious which is just—[groan] it's so ridiculous when I say it out loud.
Character 1: You thought I'd judge you for getting help?
38 Character 2: No! Well, maybe? I dunno, I wasn't thinking straight. I was just so caught up in my own head and I—I convinced myself that everyone would see me differently. Which isn't fair to you at all, I know that now.
Character 1: I've been in therapy for two years.
39 Character 2: Wait, what? You have? I had no—why didn't you ever say anything?
Character 1: Because it's normal. Not something to run away from your friends about.
40 Character 2: You're right. You're totally right and I just—I made this huge thing out of nothing and hurt you in the process. I'm really, really sorry. Can we just—can we please go back to normal? I miss you so much it literally hurts.

41 SCENARIO: noticing their phone is at 5% battery with no charger nearby
==================================================

[muttering]
Oh, come on. Five percent? Really? I just— I just checked this like an hour ago and it was at, um, it was at like thirty something. How does it just— [sigh] how does it just disappear like that?

[slightly panicked]
Okay, so, um, charger. Where's my— where's my charger? It's not in my bag, it's not— did I leave it at work? Oh god, please don't tell me I left it at work because that means I'm gonna be, like, completely cut off for the rest of the—

[thinking out loud]
Wait, okay, let me just— let me just think about this logically. I could, um, I could ask someone? But that's so awkward, like, "hey, can I borrow your charger" and then I'm just, uh, I'm just tethered to their wall for like an hour.

[resigned]
Or I could just— I could just let it die. I mean, people survived without phones for, like, thousands of years, right? It's not gonna kill me to be unreachable for a few hours. Probably.

[second-guessing]
But what if someone needs to— what if there's an emergency or something important and I just— [groan] why didn't I charge it last night?

--- CONVERSATION ---
Script: 1fc8fa85 | Role: Character 1 (A)

42 Character 1: [breathless] Oh my god, is that really you? [getting louder] I can't believe it's been three months! [nervous laugh] You look exactly the same, maybe even better—have you been working out or something?
Character 2: [strained] Hi, yeah, it's me. [quieter] I'm actually in a rush right now. [clearing throat] Got a meeting downtown in twenty minutes, so I really can't stop to chat today, sorry.
43 Character 1: [pleading tone] Just five minutes, please? [faster] I've been meaning to text you but didn't know what to say. [soft whimper] I still have your sweater at my place—the blue one you loved.
Character 2: [firmly] Keep it, donate it, whatever works. [more curtly] Look, we talked about this already. [deep exhale] There's nothing left to discuss, and I really need to catch my train now.
44 Character 1: [trembling] Are you seeing someone? [accusatory] Is that why you're being so cold? [bitter laugh] I saw you tagged at that new restaurant last week—the one we always planned to try together.
Character 2: [exasperated] My personal life isn't your concern anymore. [slower pace] We broke up, remember? [sigh] You ended things, actually—said you needed space to "find yourself" or whatever that meant back then.
45 Character 1: [defensive shout] That was a mistake! [quieter now] I was confused and scared of how serious things were getting. [sniffling] Can't we just grab coffee sometime and talk like adults about everything?
Character 2: [measured tone] No, we can't. [more firmly] I've moved on with my life, and you should too. [gentle but distant] This random encounter doesn't change anything between us—we're done, completely done.
46 Character 1: [desperately] But what about our trip to Seattle? [rambling faster] The non-refundable tickets, the hotel reservations? [choking up] I know it's next month, but maybe we could still go as friends?
Character 2: [incredulous] Are you serious right now? [harsh laugh] I cancelled everything months ago, took the loss. [coldly] Going on vacation with my ex is literally the last thing I'd ever consider doing.
47 Character 1: [wounded] You act like I'm some kind of monster. [more pitifully] All I did was love you too much. [whispered] Sometimes I drive by your apartment just to feel close to you again.
Character 2: [alarmed] That's not okay—that's stalking! [voice rising] This is exactly why we can't be friends. [shakily] Please stop contacting my friends, stop showing up places, just stop everything immediately.
48 Character 1: [frantic] Your friends still like me! [defensive tone] Rachel invited me to her party last week—I'm not some pariah. [softer] Maybe if you'd actually talk to me, I wouldn't have to reach out.
Character 2: [controlled anger] Rachel was being polite. [through gritted teeth] She told me how uncomfortable you made everyone feel. [exhale] Nobody wants to pick sides, but you're forcing them into impossible positions here.
49 Character 1: [crying now] I just miss what we had. [barely audible] Every morning I wake up expecting your texts. [desperate whisper] Don't you ever think about the good times—our Sunday brunches, movie marathons?
Character 2: [softening slightly] Of course I remember. [more distant] But dwelling on the past isn't healthy for either of us. [firmly again] You need to let go and find happiness somewhere else, seriously.
50 Character 1: [angry outburst] How can you be so heartless? [accusingly] Two years together and you act like I'm nothing! [bitter] Did I really mean that little to you all along?
Character 2: [exhausted] You meant something once, yes. [slowly] But you broke that when you cheated. [sharp intake] Or did you conveniently forget that part of our story when playing the victim?
51 Character 1: [defensive shout] It was one kiss! [quieter, ashamed] One stupid, drunken mistake at a party. [pleading again] People work through worse things—my parents did, yours did too, remember?
Character 2: [with finality] We're not them. [steadily] I'm walking away now—please don't follow me. [firm whisper] If you really loved me like you claim, you'll finally respect this boundary. Goodbye.

Script: 1474026e | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [frustrated] Look, I hired you specifically to avoid this mess! [raising voice] The IRS is claiming I owe $47,892 in back taxes, and they're saying my 2022 return—the one YOU prepared—has major discrepancies on Schedule C.
52 Customer Support: [defensive] Mr. Harrison, I prepared your return based on the documents you provided. [more firmly] You gave me receipts totaling $23,450 in business expenses, remember? [sighs] I can't verify what you don't show me.
Character 1: [angrily] Don't you dare blame this on me! [louder] I paid you $3,500 to be the expert, to catch these things! My business address at 4521 Oak Street was listed wrong, and somehow my EIN 84-7629301 got mixed up!
53 Customer Support: [apologetically] The address error was... unfortunate, yes. [more calmly] But you wrote down 4521 Oak Avenue on your intake form, not Street. [pause] And the EIN issue—that came from your QuickBooks file you uploaded on March 15th.
Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh, so now it's QuickBooks' fault? [groans] The audit letter says I claimed $18,000 in vehicle expenses without proper mileage logs. [accusingly] Didn't you tell me estimates were fine?
54 Customer Support: [firmly] I said estimates were acceptable for small amounts, not... not for half your deductions! [exasperated] The IRS Form 4549 they sent shows you claimed 42,000 business miles. [slower] Where's your documentation for that?
Character 1: [shouting] This is unbelievable! [breathing heavily] My CPA license number—sorry, YOUR CPA license 78432-B—is on every page of that return! [demanding] You're supposed to protect me from this nightmare!
55 Customer Support: [defensive tone] Mr. Harrison, being your preparer doesn't mean I can fabricate documentation. [more steadily] The audit notice CP2000 specifically questions three deposits of $15,000, $22,000, and $8,500. [carefully] You told me those were loans, but where's the paperwork?
Character 1: [desperately] They were loans from my brother-in-law! [pleading] Can't you just write them a letter explaining that? [sighs deeply] The deadline is October 23rd—that's in two weeks!
56 Customer Support: [sympathetically] I understand you're stressed, but... listen, we need actual loan agreements. [more gently] The revenue agent, Ms. Chen, badge number RA-5569, she's requesting specific documentation. [reassuring] We can still fix this if you cooperate.

57 Customer Support: [briskly] Good afternoon, I see you're calling about your account ending in 4782. [more quickly] You're currently at your credit limit of—let me see—eight thousand dollars. How can I help you today?
Character 1: [nervously] Yeah, hi, I'm... I'm actually calling because [pause] [embarrassed] I need to discuss lowering my limit. [sighs] I know I'm maxed out, but I can't keep doing this to myself.
58 Customer Support: [surprised] Oh, you want to decrease your limit? [more gently] That's actually quite responsible of you. [quickly] Most people call asking for increases, so this is refreshing to hear, honestly.
Character 1: [defensive] Well, I've been trying to get my spending under control for months. [frustrated groan] Every time I pay it down, I just—somehow—end up right back at the max. [quieter] It's like the card burns a hole in my wallet.
59 Customer Support: [professionally] I completely understand your situation. [speaking rapidly] Let me pull up the options—we can reduce it to six thousand, four thousand, or even lower if you'd prefer. [reassuring] The change would be immediate.
Character 1: [anxiously] Four thousand sounds... wait, no. [more firmly] Actually, make it three thousand. [nervous chuckle] If I'm going to do this, I need to really commit, you know?
60 Customer Support: [typing quickly] Three thousand it is—just need to confirm a few details first. [brisk tone] This is permanent until you request another change, and [pause] [carefully] any pending charges over the new limit will be declined.
Character 1: [worried] Pending charges? [panicked] Oh God, I have that automatic payment for—no wait, that's only two hundred. [relieved sigh] Okay, we're good. Please, just do it before I chicken out.
61 Customer Support: [efficiently] Processing now... and done! [cheerfully] Your new limit is three thousand dollars effective immediately. [more seriously] You'll still owe the current balance of eight thousand, of course, but no new charges above three thousand.
Character 1: [overwhelmed] Right, the eight thousand. [laughs bitterly] That's going to take forever to pay off. [determined] But at least I can't make it worse now, right?
62 Customer Support: [encouragingly] Exactly, and if you maintain your current payment schedule—let me check—[quickly] two hundred fifty monthly, you'll have significant progress within eighteen months. [helpfully] Would you like to discuss payment plan options?
Character 1: [exhausted] Maybe next month? [sighs deeply] This call was hard enough already. [gratefully] But thank you for not judging me about the whole maxed-out situation.
63 Customer Support: [warmly] There's absolutely nothing to judge—you're taking control of your finances. [speaking faster] That takes real courage, and honestly, I wish more customers would make this choice. [professionally] Is there anything else?
Character 1: [curious] Actually, yeah—can I still use the card for emergencies? [nervously] Like, if I pay some down and I'm under three thousand, it'll work normally, right?
64 Customer Support: [quickly] Absolutely, yes! [clearly] As long as you're below three thousand, the card functions normally. [reassuring] You're not closing the account, just setting a boundary for yourself.
Character 1: [relieved] Good, good. [muttering] Boundaries, that's what my therapist keeps saying I need. [louder] Who knew credit cards would be where I'd start practicing them?
65 Customer Support: [chuckles softly] Financial boundaries are actually a great place to begin! [briskly] I've noted everything in your account. [kindly] You should receive an email confirmation within the hour.
Character 1: [hopefully] Maybe in six months I'll call back and—no, wait. [catching himself] Let's not think about increases yet. [laughs] One step at a time, right?
66 Customer Support: [supportively] Exactly, one step at a time. [more firmly] Focus on that eight thousand first. [warmly] We're here if you need anything else—payment arrangements, budget tools, whatever helps.
Character 1: [sincerely] Thanks for making this easier than I expected. [sighs] Now comes the hard part—actually sticking to it. [resigned] Wish me luck, I guess.

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

67 [Slow] Oh wow, Aunt Carol, that's, um, that's quite a story about your neighbor's cat. [Chuckle] [Fast] Hey, I actually gotta run to the store before it closes!

68 [Sigh] You know what, I'd love to hear the rest but my phone's about to—it's literally at like two percent right now.

69 [Happy] Wait, someone's at the door! [Shout] Coming! [Normal] Sorry, Uncle Ted, I really should get that.

70 [Disappointed] I hate to cut you off but, uh, the dog just threw up on the—oh god, it's everywhere. [Groan]

71 [Sarcastic] No, no, please tell me more about your coworker's daughter's wedding plans. [Tsk] Actually, sorry, I'm being called into another room.

72 [Fast] The timer just went off for my—I mean, I've got something in the oven that's gonna burn if I don't... [Laugh]

73 [Whisper] Mom's calling me on the other line and you know how she gets when I don't pick up. [Sigh] I should probably take this.

74 Well, this has been really—I mean, honestly, it's been great catching up, but work starts super early tomorrow, so...

75 [Sad] I'm getting such a bad headache, Grandma. [Slow] Maybe we could, um, maybe continue this another time?

76 [Angry] What? No, not you—sorry, the kids are just—[Shout] Put that down! [Fast] I really need to deal with this situation.

77 [Chuckle] You're gonna think I'm crazy but I actually forgot I have a, uh, a thing—an appointment thing in like ten minutes.

78 [Happy] Oh my goodness, yes, we should definitely do lunch soon! [Fast] But right now I'm kinda running late for—yeah, gotta go!

79 [Disappointed] The connection's getting really bad, I can barely—what? [Tsk] I think we're breaking up here.

80 [Slow] So basically what you're saying is—actually, hold that thought, someone's beeping in and it might be important. [Sigh]

81 [Sarcastic] Fascinating stuff about your grocery store experience, really. [Chuckle] But my boss just walked in, so...

82 I dunno, Uncle Ray, my ear's getting kinda sore from holding the phone this long, y'know?

83 [Whisper] The baby finally just fell asleep and I should probably—I mean, I need to ninja my way out of this room. [Slow] Really quietly.

84 [Happy] That reminds me! [Fast] I completely forgot I promised to call Jennifer back about—oh geez, she's gonna kill me if I don't call her now.

85 [Groan] Ugh, sorry, I just remembered I left the garage door open and it's supposed to rain. [Fast] Let me just—I'll call you back later?

86 [Sad] Listen, Dad, this has been nice but I'm just emotionally drained from today and I think I need to just... [Sigh] [Slow] decompress a little.

87 SCENARIO: Complaining about a rude driver, then admits they didn't signal either
==================================================

[frustrated]
Oh my god, you should have seen this absolute maniac on the highway today. Like this guy just— he just cuts right in front of me, no warning, nothing, just [scoff] swoops right into my lane like I don't even exist.

[annoyed]
And I'm going like seventy already, right? So I have to slam on my brakes, and my coffee goes everywhere, and this guy just keeps weaving through traffic like he's in some kind of, I don't know, Fast and Furious movie or something.

[getting worked up]
Like what is wrong with people? Use your signal! It's literally right there on your steering wheel, it's not— it's not rocket science, you know? Just give people a heads up so they don't die.

[indignant]
So I'm following behind him for like ten minutes, just watching him pull the same crap with other cars, and I'm thinking this guy shouldn't even have a license, like—

[pause] [quieter]
Wait. Wait, hold on. When I changed lanes to get behind him... did I... 

[sheepish] [half laugh]
Oh god. I didn't signal either, did I? I was so focused on being mad at him that I just— [groan] I totally did the exact same thing to the car behind me.

[embarrassed] [small laugh]
Okay, maybe we're both idiots. Maybe I should just... invest in more coffee lids and call it even.
