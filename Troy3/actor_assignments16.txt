Character 1: So I bought a house.
1242 Character 2: Wait wait wait—you WHAT? You bought a—oh my god, are you serious right now? Like an actual house? With walls and a roof and everything?
Character 1: Yeah. Closed yesterday.
1243 Character 2: I'm—okay I'm literally gonna cry. This is huge! Like, this is so so huge. How are you feeling? Are you totally freaking out or—actually, you seem pretty calm about it.
Character 1: It doesn't feel real yet.
1244 Character 2: No no no, that's totally normal though. Like when I got my car I didn't believe it was mine for like... weeks? [Laugh] But a house is way bigger than that, obviously.
Character 1: The paperwork was insane. Had to sign my name about two hundred times.
1245 Character 2: Oh god, the paperwork—yeah, my cousin just went through that and she said her hand was literally cramping by the end. But hey, you did it! You're like, officially an adult now or whatever.
Character 1: I was already an adult.
1246 Character 2: Okay okay, but you know what I mean. This is different. This is like—you own property now. That's kinda wild to think about, right? Like you have a deed and everything?
Character 1: Yeah. And a thirty-year mortgage.
1247 Character 2: [Groan] Ugh, don't—don't even mention the M word. But honestly? Still worth it. No more landlords, no more rent increases, no more asking permission to hang a picture. That's gotta feel good.
Character 1: I can paint the walls whatever color I want.
1248 Character 2: Yes! See, that's—that's what I'm talking about! What color are you thinking? Please don't say beige. Everyone always picks beige and it's so... boring.
Character 1: Maybe dark green. Or navy.
1249 Character 2: Ooh, moody—I love it. Very like, sophisticated and grown-up. When do you actually move in? Do you need help? Because I'm totally available to carry boxes or whatever you need.
Character 1: Next weekend. And yes, I'll need help.
1250 Character 2: Um, obviously I'll be there. With coffee and donuts because that's what you do for moves, right? [Sigh] God, I can't believe you bought a house. Remember when we couldn't even afford decent ramen?
Character 1: That was last month.
1251 Character 2: Okay but—shut up, you know what I mean! This is just... I'm really really proud of you. Like genuinely. You worked so hard for this.

Character 1: You brought up the Jamie thing again. In front of everyone.
1252 Character 2: I didn't—okay, I mentioned it, but only because it was literally relevant to what we were talking about. Like, everyone was sharing stories about—y'know what, never mind, you're already pissed.
Character 1: It's been three years.
1253 Character 2: Yeah, and? That doesn't mean it just disappears. You never actually apologized for that whole mess, you just—[sigh] we just stopped talking about it and pretended everything was fine.
Character 1: So you're punishing me.
1254 Character 2: No! God, that's not—I'm not punishing anyone. But sometimes stuff comes up naturally in conversation and I can't just, like, edit my entire history because you wanna pretend it didn't happen.
Character 1: I thought we moved past it.
1255 Character 2: You moved past it. You decided we were done talking about it and that was that. I never got to actually—look, I tried to bring it up a few times and you always shut me down, so...
Character 1: So you wait until there's an audience.
1256 Character 2: That's—okay okay, that's not fair. I didn't plan this. It just came out because, honestly? [frustrated laugh] Maybe I'm still kinda messed up about it. Maybe I needed to actually deal with it instead of just burying it.
Character 1: Three. Years.
1257 Character 2: I know how long it's been! But time doesn't just magically fix things that never got resolved. You hurt me—like, really hurt me—and we never actually talked about it. We just... moved on.
Character 1: What do you want from me?
1258 Character 2: I dunno, maybe just acknowledge that it happened? That it mattered? Instead of acting like I'm—like I'm crazy for still having feelings about it. You can't just decide when someone else should be over something.
Character 1: Fine. Let's resolve it then.
1259 Character 2: Oh, come on, don't—don't do that. Don't make it sound like some chore you're gonna check off your list. [scoff] This is exactly what you did last time.
Character 1: I'm trying here.
1260 Character 2: Are you though? Because it feels like you're just—you're mad that I embarrassed you, not that there's actually something unfinished between us. Like, you still don't think you did anything wrong, do you?
Character 1: And bringing it up at dinner helped how exactly?
1261 Character 2: It didn't—I know it didn't help, okay? I'm not saying it was the right time or place, but sometimes stuff just... bubbles up. And maybe if we'd actually dealt with it properly, it wouldn't keep happening. I'm sorry it came out like that, but I'm not sorry for still feeling some type of way about it.

Script: 05101621_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: Three years, Jamie. Three years I've been vegan.
1262 Character 2: I know, I know, okay? I just—there was so much going on with planning this thing and I literally had like twenty people to coordinate and somehow it just... slipped my mind. [frustrated laugh] Which I realize sounds terrible.
Character 1: It always slips your mind.
1263 Character 2: That's not—come on, that's not true. Remember your birthday? I made that whole separate dish just for you. And—and the barbecue last month? I literally bought those expensive vegan burgers.
Character 1: Two times. Out of how many?
1264 Character 2: Okay, fine, maybe I'm not perfect about it, but you're acting like I do this intentionally. I don't—I genuinely forgot this time. There's a difference between forgetting and not caring.
Character 1: Is there? Because from here they look the same.
1265 Character 2: That's... [scoff] wow. That's really what you think of me? After everything? I mean, I'm sorry I'm not keeping a spreadsheet of everyone's dietary stuff, but I'm trying here.
Character 1: No. You're not.
1266 Character 2: I—okay, you know what? Maybe I'm not trying hard enough for your standards, but I'm also planning these entire get-togethers while everyone else just shows up. Including you. So maybe—maybe cut me some slack?
Character 1: I offered to help. You said no.
1267 Character 2: Because you offering to help doesn't—it doesn't fix the fact that I should remember, I get that. But honestly? Sometimes it feels like you're just... waiting for me to mess up so you can be disappointed.
Character 1: I had nothing to eat. At my best friend's party.
1268 Character 2: And that sucks, it really does, and I'm—look, I am sorry about that part. [sigh] But you could've reminded me when I sent the group chat about food. Like, one text. That's all.
Character 1: I shouldn't have to.
1269 Character 2: No, you shouldn't. You're right. But we're—we're supposed to be friends, right? And sometimes friends mess up. I dunno, I just thought you'd be more... understanding, I guess.
Character 1: Understanding. Right.
1270 Character 2: Don't do that—don't make it sound like—ugh. Look look, I screwed up, okay? I admit it. But you're acting like this is some massive betrayal when it's literally just... my brain being garbage at remembering details.
Character 1: It's not a detail. It's who I am.
1271 Character 2: That's—okay, that's fair. That's actually... yeah. [quieter] I didn't think about it like that. I just—I saw it as a food thing, not a... you thing. Which I guess is the problem, huh.

Script: 45c243c9_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: An hour. A full hour.
1272 Character 2: I know, I know, I'm so sorry—there was this whole thing with the subway and then I—wait, actually no, let me start over. I should've texted you. I totally should've texted.
Character 1: You think?
1273 Character 2: Okay, yeah, that's—that's fair. Um, honestly? I lost track of time at first, which I know sounds terrible but then the train just stopped for like twenty minutes and I couldn't get signal underground [nervous laugh] and I kept thinking "they're gonna kill me, they're literally gonna kill me."
Character 1: I waited outside. In the cold.
1274 Character 2: Oh god, you—you waited outside? I thought you'd just grab a table and—no, that's even worse, isn't it? You were just standing there waiting for me like an idiot because I'm an idiot.
Character 1: Pretty much.
1275 Character 2: I'm really, really sorry. Like, genuinely. This isn't—I don't mean to be that friend, y'know? The one who's always late and everyone just expects it. That's not who I wanna be.
Character 1: But you are. Every single time.
1276 Character 2: I—yeah. Yeah, you're right. [Sigh] I guess I am. It's not on purpose though, I swear, it's just like my brain doesn't process time right or something? That sounds like an excuse—it is an excuse. Sorry.
Character 1: I almost left. Three times.
1277 Character 2: But you didn't? You—you stayed and waited for me even though I'm literally the worst friend ever and I don't deserve—sorry, I'm not trying to make this about me. I just... thank you for not leaving.
Character 1: Don't thank me. I'm still mad.
1278 Character 2: No no no, totally get that. You should be mad. I would be—actually, I'd probably have left after like fifteen minutes, so the fact that you stayed means you're basically a saint and I'm just this disaster person who can't even—[groan] I'm doing it again, aren't I? The rambling thing.
Character 1: Yeah. You are.
1279 Character 2: Right. Okay. Shutting up now. Except—wait, can I just say one more thing? I'm gonna set like five alarms next time. Actually, you know what? You can just tell me to show up an hour before you actually wanna meet.
Character 1: That's... actually not a terrible idea.
1280 Character 2: Really? You're not—I mean, you're still mad, I can tell, but like... we're okay? Or we're gonna be okay? Eventually?
Character 1: Buy me lunch. And coffee. And dessert.
1281 Character 2: Yes! Absolutely, whatever you want—I'm buying everything. The most expensive thing on the menu, I don't even care. And next time I'm gonna be early, I swear, like awkwardly early where I'm just sitting there for twenty minutes checking my phone.

Script: 567104fd_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: Got promoted yesterday.
1282 Character 2: Wait wait wait—what? You got—oh my god, are you serious? That's like, that's incredible! I mean, finally, right? They've been making you wait forever for this.
Character 1: Yeah. Senior director now.
1283 Character 2: Senior director! That's—okay, that's huge. Like, actually huge. How are you even being so calm about this? I'd be literally bouncing off the walls [Laugh] or something.
Character 1: Still processing it, I guess.
1284 Character 2: No no, I get it, I totally get it. It's like—you work so hard for something and then when it actually happens you're just... numb? Kinda? But seriously, you've earned this.
Character 1: Three years of overtime. Three years of their promises.
1285 Character 2: God, three years—that's actually criminal how long they made you wait. But you never gave up, y'know? Even when they kept moving the goalposts and being all—ugh, corporate nonsense.
Character 1: Almost quit twice.
1286 Character 2: I remember! That one time you were literally—you had the resignation letter drafted and everything. [Sigh] Thank god you didn't though, right? I mean, look at you now.
Character 1: They apologized. Can you believe that?
1287 Character 2: They—wait, they actually apologized? Like, management admitted they were wrong? That's... honestly that's kinda unheard of. What did they even say?
Character 1: Said they should've done this last year. Budget issues or whatever.
1288 Character 2: Budget issues, sure sure—I mean, it's always budget issues, isn't it? But at least they're like, acknowledging it now. Are you gonna celebrate or—actually, we should definitely celebrate.
Character 1: Maybe. Don't really do celebrations.
1289 Character 2: Okay okay, but this is different! This is like—you've been grinding for this forever, and I've watched you just... pour everything into that place. Even just dinner? Something small?
Character 1: Fine. But somewhere quiet.
1290 Character 2: Yes! Perfect, totally—we can go to that place you like with the, um, the really good pasta? [Chuckle] The one where they don't play music too loud?
Character 1: That works. Thanks for... you know.
1291 Character 2: Oh stop—no no, don't even. I'm just, I'm really proud of you, okay? Like genuinely. You deserve every bit of this, even if you're gonna be all modest about it.

1292 SCENARIO: discovering their pen ran out mid-signature
==================================================

[matter-of-fact]
Okay, so I just need to, um, I just need to sign this and then I can— [pause] wait. Wait, what? The pen just— did the pen just stop working?

[slightly incredulous]
Are you kidding me right now? I'm like, I'm literally halfway through my last name and the, uh, the pen just decides to— [tsk] great. Just great. Of course this would happen when I'm, um, when I'm trying to finish this stupid form.

[muttering, annoyed]
Let me just— let me try scribbling on the side here, maybe it'll— no. No, it's definitely dead. Super dead. I mean, it was working fine two seconds ago, and now it's just, uh, now it's just giving me nothing.

[resigned but thinking]
Okay, so do I— do I need to find another pen, or can I just, like, can I just initial next to it? Like, would that count? I feel like that— that probably doesn't count, right?

[trailing off, practical]
I should probably just— I mean, I've got other pens somewhere. This is, um, this is not actually a crisis. Just a minor... pen situation.

Character 1: [triumphant roar] The castle is OURS! [breathless] Look how our banner catches the wind atop their highest tower. [getting louder] Twenty years of fighting, and finally—FINALLY—we've brought these tyrants to their knees!
1293 Character 2: [exhausted but elated] My sword arm burns like fire, but by God, it was worth every swing. [deep satisfied sigh] Their so-called impenetrable walls crumbled like bread. [building excitement] We actually did it, brother!
Character 1: [quieter, awed] Remember when we were squires, dreaming of glory like this? [nostalgic chuckle] Now their throne room echoes with our footsteps. [voice breaking] My father would've wept to see this cursed place finally fall.
1294 Character 2: [gravely] The cost was steep though. [slower pace] Young Marcus, brave Thomas, that fool Geoffrey with his jokes... [bitter laugh] They should be here planting this flag with us, not lying cold in the mud below.
Character 1: [fiercely] They died as warriors should—with honor! [softer now] Their names will be carved in stone, sung in every tavern. [rising intensity] This victory belongs to them as much as to us standing here!
1295 Character 2: [weary tone] What now, though? [contemplative] We've toppled kings, conquered the unconquerable. [nervous laugh] Do we become lords ourselves, or does the road call us to more battles, more blood, more glory somewhere else?
Character 1: [dismissive snort] Lords? Us? [incredulous] Can you imagine me in silk robes, collecting taxes? [getting faster] No, no—there are other tyrants, other walls to breach, other wrongs that need our swords, brother!
1296 Character 2: [relieved laughter] Thank God you said it first! [warmly] I was terrified you'd want to settle down, grow fat on wine. [loud declaration] Our work isn't finished until every corrupt castle bears a righteous flag!
Character 1: [sudden shout] Look there! [hushed amazement] The sun breaks through the storm clouds, shining on our colors. [reverent whisper] If that's not a sign from Heaven blessing our cause, then I'm a court jester's monkey.
1297 Character 2: [joyful bellow] Then let them hear us from the valleys to the mountains! [commanding tone] Victory is ours! [Thunderous roar] The age of tyranny ends today, and the age of justice begins NOW!

Character 1: [nervously] So I wrapped Mom's gift last night, the silk scarf from that boutique downtown. [speeding up] You know, the one with the peacock pattern she kept eyeing? [Soft giggle] Cost me half my paycheck but totally worth it.
1298 Character 2: [confused] Wait, wait, wait. [slower] The blue and green peacock scarf? [voice rising] From Margot's Boutique on Fifth Street? Because I literally have that exact same scarf [Nervous laugh] sitting in my car right now.
Character 1: [Shrieking laugh] No no no no NO! [breathlessly] This cannot be happening! We literally live in different cities and somehow bought the [voice cracking] SAME scarf? [Snort] Mom's going to think we coordinated this like five-year-olds!
1299 Character 2: [hysterically] I'm dying, I'm actually dying right now! [Gasping breath] Remember when we were kids and showed up in matching outfits? [quieter] She's never letting us live this down. [Cackling] Never ever ever.
Character 1: [whimpering] The receipt's at home and the party's in two hours. [more frantically] Maybe we could say it's intentional? Like, [sarcastically sweet] "Oh Mom, we got you matching scarves so you'll never lose one!" [Groaning laugh]
1300 Character 2: [mockingly] Oh brilliant, yes, because every woman dreams of duplicate scarves! [Hissing laugh] Or wait— [excited whisper] what if I return mine super quick and grab those earrings instead? [hopefully] The mall's still open for another hour.
Character 1: [relieved shout] YES! Do that! [more calmly] Actually no, traffic's horrible right now with the parade. [defeated] You'd never make it back. [Bitter chuckle] We're stuck being the twins who can't gift separately.
1301 Character 2: [in disbelief] Three hundred dollar scarves. [voice dropping] Three HUNDRED dollars each and we picked the same one. [Explosive laugh] At least it proves we both have expensive taste? [weakly] That's genetic, right? Good genes?
Character 1: [through tears] Stop making me laugh, my mascara's running! [Hiccupping giggle] Dad's going to roast us forever about this. [mimicking deep voice] "Six hundred dollars for one scarf, impressive economics girls!" [more hysterically] We're never hearing the end!
1302 Character 2: [panicking] Oh God, Aunt Linda's going to post about this on Facebook! [in dread] "My nieces bought their mother matching scarves, so precious!" [Choking laugh] With like fifty emoji hearts. [resigned] Our reputation as adults is officially over.
Character 1: [giggling uncontrollably] You know what though? [more warmly] At least we both noticed what she wanted. [softly] That's pretty sweet actually. [Snorting] Even if we're complete disasters at coordinating surprise gifts between us.
1303 Character 2: [sarcastically bright] Oh sure, we're very observant! [deadpan] So observant we observed the exact same thing. [Wheezing laugh] Next year we're making a shared spreadsheet. [firmly] With color coding and everything, I'm not kidding anymore.
Character 1: [mock serious] Spreadsheet? We need a whole database at this point! [getting louder] Password protected, encrypted, with two-factor authentication! [Cackling] "Sarah's Gift Security System" has a nice ring to it, [teasingly] don't you think?
1304 Character 2: [exhausted] I can't breathe, seriously stop! [Gasping] My stomach hurts from laughing. [in a whisper] But imagine Mom's face when she opens the second one. [building up] "Oh wow, another peacock scarf, how... thoughtful?"
Character 1: [gleefully] We could make it a competition! [faster] "Mom, judge which daughter wrapped theirs better!" [melodramatically] "Which peacock speaks to your soul more deeply?" [Shrieking giggle] Turn our disaster into performance art, why not?
1305 Character 2: [resigned laugh] You're insane but I love it. [thoughtfully] Although knowing Mom, she'll probably keep both and wear them [sing-song voice] at the same time somehow. [Snort] Remember her layering phase? This is perfect actually.
Character 1: [suddenly hopeful] Wait that's TRUE! [excitedly building] She literally wore three necklaces to brunch last week! [triumphant] We didn't buy duplicates, we bought her a matching SET! [Victorious cackle] We're geniuses! Accidental fashion-forward gift-giving geniuses!
1306 Character 2: [playing along] Absolutely! [in fake commercial voice] "The Peacock Scarf Collection, by daughters who definitely planned this!" [normally] We should walk in together holding them up like [Giggling] synchronized swimmers. [determined] Own it completely, no shame.
Character 1: [mischievously] Let's tie them together into one mega-scarf! [Wheezing] Six feet of peacock glory wrapped around her! [more seriously] But honestly? [sweetly] She'll probably cry happy tears anyway because we both thought of her.
1307 Character 2: [tenderly] You're right, she really will. [Soft laugh] Two disasters of daughters who love her enough to buy the same overpriced scarf. [warmly building] Come on, let's go face this together. [cheerfully] Matching gift bags and everything!

Character 1: [frustrated] Hi, I've been trying to log into the patient portal for, um, three days now, and it keeps saying my password is wrong. [sighs heavily] My patient ID is MRN-45782, and I—I know I'm using the right password because I wrote it down last time, [more defensively] right here on this sticky note.
1308 Customer Support: [professionally] Good morning, I can definitely help you with that portal access issue. [reassuring tone] Let me pull up your account using that MRN number—45782, correct? [more carefully] While I'm looking, have you tried the "forgot password" link on the login page at www.healthportal.medcenter.org/reset?
Character 1: [exasperated] Yes, yes, I tried that already! It sent a reset link to my email—the one ending in @gmail, not the Yahoo one—but [groans] when I click it, it just takes me to an error page. [more urgently] My appointment with Dr. Harrison is tomorrow at 2:30 PM, and I need to fill out those pre-visit forms!
1309 Customer Support: [sympathetically] I completely understand your urgency, especially with tomorrow's appointment approaching. [in a helpful tone] I see here your email on file is actually patricia.k.wilson@yahoo.com, not Gmail—could that be why? [pause] Let me update it right now to your current Gmail address, if you can verify it for me?
Character 1: [surprised] Oh! No, no, the Yahoo is correct—I meant the reset email went there, not Gmail. [chuckles nervously] Sorry, I'm just so flustered with all these different accounts and passwords. [more clearly] But the link from that Yahoo email, the one that came at 9:47 AM yesterday, that's what's not working.
1310 Customer Support: [understanding] No worries at all, these portals can definitely be confusing sometimes. [more focused] I'm seeing that particular reset link expired after 24 hours, which would be, um, 9:47 AM today. [cheerfully] Let me generate a fresh one for you right now—it'll be valid for the next 48 hours this time.
Character 1: [relieved] Oh thank goodness! Wait, but—but what about my username? [confused] Is it my email address or that weird number thing they gave me at registration? [more anxiously] The paper from June 15th says "User: PW45782" but that doesn't work either!
1311 Customer Support: [clarifying tone] Your username should actually be your full email address, not that PW number—that's just your temporary access code from initial registration. [more patiently] Sometimes the system gets confused if you're using autofill on your browser. [helpfully] Try clearing your cache or, even better, using an incognito window when you attempt to log in.
Character 1: [slightly embarrassed] Incognito window? I—I don't really know what that means, I'm not super tech-savvy. [sighs] My daughter usually helps me with this stuff, but she's in Seattle until Thursday. [more determined] Can't you just, like, reset the whole account or give me a new one at this point?
1312 Customer Support: [warmly] Of course, I can walk you through it step by step, no worries! [encouraging] For now, I've sent that new reset link to your Yahoo email—should arrive within 2-3 minutes. [more specifically] When you get it, click the blue button that says "Reset Now," enter the temporary password XK9-TMP-2024, then create your own new password with at least 8 characters.

1313 Customer Support: [firmly] Sir, I understand you're upset about the temperature of your food. [sighs] Let me—let me pull up your order details here. [more calmly] When exactly did you pick it up?
Character 1: [frustrated] Twenty minutes ago! [louder] Your staff said it was ready, but it's stone cold. [sarcastically] I mean, my chicken parmesan is basically... refrigerated at this point.
1314 Customer Support: [apologetically] That's absolutely not acceptable, and I'm truly sorry. [quickly] We pride ourselves on hot, fresh food—this shouldn't happen. [more firmly] Can you bring the order back so we can remake it immediately?
Character 1: [exasperated] Bring it back? [groans] I've already driven home, unpacked everything for my family. [bitterly] My kids are hungry NOW, not in another forty minutes.
1315 Customer Support: [understanding] Of course, of course, I completely understand your frustration. [briskly] Here's what I can do—we'll prepare a fresh order right away. [reassuringly] And naturally, there'll be no charge for either meal.
Character 1: [skeptically] No charge for both? [pause] [softer] Well, that's... that's something, I suppose. [more firmly] But how do I know the next one won't be cold too?
1316 Customer Support: [confidently] I'll personally supervise the kitchen myself this time. [quickly] In fact—wait, let me check—yes, I can have our driver deliver it. [earnestly] Should be there in, oh, twenty-five minutes maximum.
Character 1: [surprised] You'll deliver it? [calming down] That's actually... helpful. [sighs] Look, I don't mean to be difficult, but this was supposed to be a special dinner.
1317 Customer Support: [sympathetically] No, no, you're not being difficult at all—cold food ruins everything. [briskly] I'm adding a complimentary dessert for your trouble. [warmly] What's the special occasion, if you don't mind me asking?
Character 1: [quietly] My daughter's honor roll celebration. [chuckles softly] She worked so hard this semester, and I just wanted... [trailing off] I wanted everything to be perfect.
1318 Customer Support: [touched] Oh, that's wonderful—congratulations to her! [enthusiastically] You know what? Let me throw in our chocolate lava cake too. [quickly] Kids love that one, trust me.
Character 1: [grateful] That's very kind of you. [relieved] I appreciate you actually listening instead of just... reading from a script. [curiously] Are you the actual manager?
1319 Customer Support: [chuckling] Yes, fifteen years now, believe it or not. [briskly] Listen, I'm writing a note for your file—next visit, appetizers are on us. [sincerely] We want to make this right.
Character 1: [appreciatively] Thank you, really. [lighter] My wife was ready to never order from you again. [laughs] She's the one who usually handles these calls—much less patiently.
1320 Customer Support: [laughing] I've dealt with my share of those calls! [quickly] Your driver's name is Marcus, he'll text when he's close. [reassuringly] Everything will be piping hot, I promise.
Character 1: [relieved] Perfect. [sighs] Sorry for getting heated earlier—no pun intended. [sheepishly] It's just frustrating when you're counting on something, you know?

Okay, so there's this song, um, there's this song that's been stuck in my head all morning and I cannot— I cannot for the life of me remember what it's called. It's like, um, it goes something like... [hum] da da da something something...

The thing is, um, the thing is I know all the words when it comes on, like, I can sing along perfectly, but now when I'm trying to think of it, it's just... [groan] it's just this weird melody floating around in my brain.

[thoughtful]
Wait, okay, let me think. Was it playing at the coffee shop yesterday? Or maybe it was on that, uh, that playlist I was listening to while I was— hmm. Actually, you know what, maybe if I just ignore it, it'll come to me.

Yeah, right. Like that ever works. It's gonna bug me all day until I'm, like, brushing my teeth tonight and then suddenly I'll be like "OH, it was that song!" [chuckle] Classic.

Alright, so, uh, so my options are: wash a bowl, eat out of the pot, or just, I don't know, eat standing over the stove like some kind of— like some kind of animal. Which, honestly, doesn't sound that bad right now.

[slightly conflicted]
The thing is, I could totally take like a long weekend, maybe go see my sister, or just— just stay home and do absolutely nothing for once. Which sounds, uh, which sounds amazing, honestly. But then there's this voice in my head that's like, "what if something comes up?" [laugh] What if? What if what?

1349 SCENARIO: discovering the ice cream is freezer burned

[excited]
Okay, so I've been, um, I've been craving this ice cream all day, like literally all day, and I finally get home and I'm gonna— I'm gonna treat myself, you know? Just, uh, just a little bowl of that mint chocolate chip that I got last week.

[confused, muttering]
But what is— what is this? It looks all, um, all weird and crystally. Like, there's these white spots all over it, and it's— [tsk] oh no. Oh no no no, this is, um, this is freezer burn, isn't it?

[disappointed, drawn out]
Ughhhhh, seriously? I mean, how does this even— how does this even happen? I just bought this, like, what, a week ago? Maybe two weeks? [pause] Okay, maybe it was, uh, maybe it was longer than that.

[resigned but practical]
I guess I could just, um, scrape off the gross parts? The middle might be okay, right? People do that. That's a thing people do. [hmm] Or I could just— I could just accept that this is my life now.

Oh no. Oh no no no. I think I— I think I told him twelve-thirty too? But that can't be right, that can't— [nervous laugh] I'm not that stupid, right? I mean, I literally just, um, I just wrote it down yesterday.

Great. Cool. So I'm apparently meeting two different people at the exact same time. That's, um, that's fantastic planning on my part.

I mean, I looked outside, I saw that it was, um, that it was cloudy, but I didn't think it was gonna be this— this soggy. Like, the ground is just completely soaked from last night and I'm wearing my, uh, my canvas sneakers. My canvas sneakers. [tsk] Brilliant choice there.

Okay, so I'm supposed to start at the, uh, the fat end, right? The bottom part where there's that little air bubble thing. [tap tap] That should make it easier, or— or at least that's what my mom always said, but I mean, my mom also said a lot of things that turned out to be—

[slightly skeptical]
Three years for, um, for twelve dollars extra. That's not— that's not terrible, I guess? But like, what even breaks on a toaster? The, uh, the heating things? The cord? [hmm] I've never actually had a toaster break on me.

[thinking out loud]
But then again, Murphy's Law, right? The second I don't get the warranty, it's gonna— it's gonna just die. Like, immediately. Day after the regular warranty runs out, boom, dead toaster. [sigh] That would be so typical.

Wait, but what if I move? Am I gonna— am I gonna keep the receipt? Will I even remember I have a warranty? I can barely remember to, um, to pay my phone bill half the time.

[scoff] Like I get it, I'm stressed, the algorithm knows I'm stressed, but I don't need some— some wellness guru telling me to breathe.

[frustrated]
And the worst part is you can't skip it! It's one of those unskippable ones, so I'm just sitting there for thirty seconds listening to this woman be like "Release your tension" while I'm getting more tense by the second. [groan] I was literally yelling at my laptop like "I don't want your app!"

[annoyed]
But then I'm thinking about it after, and I'm like... God, maybe I do need something like that? Like not that specific app, but just— I don't know, I've been really wound up lately with work and everything.

Actually, you know what? Maybe the algorithm isn't wrong. [half laugh] I mean, if I'm getting angry at meditation ads, that's probably... that's probably a sign I need to meditate, right?

Like, how does that even happen? I'm so careful with these things, I always put them back in the sleeves, I clean them, I— [groan] I don't know, maybe it was when Jake was over and he was like pawing through everything.

[bitter]
And of course it's on "Moanin'" which is like, literally the best song on the album. The whole reason I bought this pressing in the first place. Sixty bucks down the drain because someone can't keep their hands to themselves.

So I'm like, whatever, I'll just— I'll put it on anyway, see how bad the damage is. Maybe I can return it or something, I don't know.

[conversational]
So they called me last week and I just, like, told them the truth. He was fine, showed up on time, did his work. Nothing spectacular but nothing terrible either. Pretty standard stuff.

And Jake texted me right after to thank me, said the interview went really well, he was feeling good about it. I was like, cool, glad I could help.

But then— oh wait, he's texting me right now actually. [pause] He says he didn't get it. Says they told him his references were... "mixed."

Mixed? I was his only reference from that job. Oh god. [nervous laugh] What did I say exactly? I said he was "adequate" didn't I?

Oh no, oh no. I said he was "fine." Who describes someone as just "fine" if they actually want them to get hired? [groan] I basically damned him with faint praise!

So you know how Jessica is always— like, always giving me advice about my dating life? Well today she was going on and on about how I need to "stop being so available" and like, "make him wonder where I am sometimes."

[annoyed]
And I'm just like, okay Jessica, thanks, but I didn't ask? Like me and Ryan are fine, we text throughout the day, we see each other on weekends, it's— it's working for us, you know?

[irritated] 
She keeps being like "you're too eager" and "guys like the chase" and I'm like, ugh, we're adults, we're not playing games. If I want to text him, I'm gonna text him. If I want to see him, I'll— I'll make plans.

[trailing off] [quieter]
But like... now that I'm actually saying this out loud, I'm realizing— God, okay, so Ryan has been a little... distant lately? Like he used to initiate plans and now it's always me being like "what are you doing this weekend" or whatever.

[reluctant realization]
And last week when I texted him good morning every day, he only replied to like... two of them. [sigh] Which at the time I was like, oh he's just busy, but maybe—

[grudging] [slightly embarrassed]
Maybe Jessica actually... maybe she has a point. [groan] I hate when she's right. I really hate it.

1368 SCENARIO: Mad about a price increase, then finding a coupon that makes it cheaper than before
==================================================

[frustrated]
Okay so you know that protein powder I've been buying? The good one, the one that actually— like, actually tastes decent? They jacked up the price by like eight dollars. Eight dollars! 

[annoyed]
I'm standing there at checkout and I'm like, this has to be wrong, right? Like this can't— this can't be right. So I ask the guy and he's like "oh yeah, supply chain issues" or whatever. 

[angry]
Eight dollars more for the same exact container! I was so— [scoff] I was so mad I almost just left it there. Like, I need this stuff for my workouts but I'm not gonna get, you know, totally ripped off.

[grumbling]
So I bought it anyway because I'm almost out, but I was just— God, I was fuming the whole drive home. Like, everything's getting more expensive and it's just—

[surprised]
Oh wait, wait. There's something in the bag. Hold on, what is this? 

[excited] [amazed]
Dude. There's a coupon in here. Like a— a manufacturer's coupon for twelve dollars off my next purchase. Twelve dollars! 

[laughing] [relieved]
So I'm actually gonna save money compared to the old price. [chuckle] I went from wanting to boycott them to being like their biggest fan in the span of ten minutes.

1369 SCENARIO: Matter-of-factly talking about a funny autocorrect their phone made, then checking recent messages, then finding it's been autocorrecting something embarrassing in multiple texts they didn't catch, ending in texting horror
==================================================

[casual]
Oh my god, so you know how my phone has been doing that weird autocorrect thing lately? This morning I texted my mom about picking up groceries and it changed "milk" to "mulk." [light laugh] Like, what even is mulk? I don't think that's a word.

[conversational]
She texted back like "what's mulk, honey?" and I'm like, oh great, now my mom thinks I'm having a stroke or something. But you know, whatever, autocorrect is weird, it happens to everyone.

[matter-of-fact]
Actually, let me check what other genius corrections it's been making lately. I feel like it's been getting worse... [pause] Oh. Oh wait.

[a bit concerned]
Um. Okay, so apparently when I texted Jake yesterday about meeting for drinks, instead of "Can't wait to see you" it sent "Can't wait to sex you." [nervous laugh] That's... that's not great.

[more worried]
And when I texted my boss about the meeting... [groan] it changed "I'll bring the documents" to "I'll bring the condoms." Oh my god. Oh my GOD.

[spiraling]
How many— how many people have gotten these? [frantic] My dentist, my landlord, my GRANDMOTHER— [sharp exhale] I texted my grandmother about Sunday dinner!

[panicked]
What if she got some horrifying autocorrect and she's just sitting there thinking I've lost my mind? [whimper] I'm never texting again. Ever.

1370 SCENARIO: Frustrated about a confusing form, then the help desk walking them through it
==================================================

[frustrated]
Oh my god, so I had to fill out this form today for the insurance thing, and I swear it was like— it was like they designed it to be as confusing as possible. Like, "Section C refers to subsection 4.2b unless you answered yes to question 7a in which case..." [groan] What does that even mean?

[annoyed]
I'm sitting there for like an hour just staring at this thing, and I'm like, am I stupid? Like, I have a college degree, I should be able to figure out a stupid form, right? But it's asking for all these codes and reference numbers that I don't— I don't even know where to find half of them.

[exasperated]
So finally I'm like, okay, I have to call the help desk, which you know I hate doing because they always make you feel like an idiot for not knowing their weird system, and I'm expecting this whole runaround...

[surprised] [softer]
But wait, actually— okay so this woman picks up, Sarah, and she was actually really nice? Like she immediately was like "Oh yeah, that form is confusing, everyone calls about it."

[relieved] [grateful]
And she just walked me through it step by step, like really patiently. Turns out half those fields I was stressing about? You can just leave them blank if they don't apply. [small laugh] Twenty minutes and we had the whole thing done. I felt so much better after, like... sometimes people actually want to help, you know?
