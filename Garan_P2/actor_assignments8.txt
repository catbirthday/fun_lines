Character 1: We need to talk about Saturday.
550 Character 2: Oh god, okay—look, I know you're mad about the party thing, but can we just—I mean, I told you weeks ago that wasn't gonna work for me.
Character 1: You say that about everything.
551 Character 2: That's not—that's literally not true. We hung out last week! We went to that movie, we got coffee, we did plenty of stuff.
Character 1: Just the two of us. Always just the two of us.
552 Character 2: Because that's what I'm comfortable with! [Sigh] Like, I don't get why that's suddenly this huge problem when you've known this about me forever.
Character 1: It's not sudden. I'm just tired of missing things.
553 Character 2: Missing—okay okay, so now I'm ruining your life? That's what you're saying? Because I can't just magically be okay with crowds and strangers and all that noise?
Character 1: That's not what I said.
554 Character 2: But it's what you meant, right? I mean, come on. You're basically telling me I'm a bad friend because I have anxiety, which—honestly, that's kinda messed up.
Character 1: You won't even try.
555 Character 2: I do try! I try all the [frustrated laugh] time! You just don't see it because trying for me doesn't look like—like just showing up to some random house party with fifty people I don't know.
Character 1: Twenty people. My birthday party.
556 Character 2: Your—wait, that's what this is about? That's not fair, you said you understood. You literally said "it's fine, don't worry about it" and now you're throwing it in my face?
Character 1: I lied.
557 Character 2: Well that's—I mean, what am I supposed to do with that? I can't go back and un-miss it. And honestly, I would've just had a panic attack anyway, so.
Character 1: You could've taken your meds. You could've left early. Something.
558 Character 2: Oh, so now you're my therapist? Look look, I get that you're hurt, okay? I do. But you're acting like I'm choosing this, like I wake up and decide "hey, let's disappoint everyone today."
Character 1: Aren't you?
559 Character 2: Wow. Okay. Fine fine, if that's really what you think of me, then I dunno why we're even—[scoff] I guess I'm sorry for having a mental illness that inconveniences you.

Character 1: So we're just pretending Monday didn't happen?
560 Character 2: What? No, I—I thought we were good. We talked it out, didn't we? I mean, you said you understood where I was coming from and I said I got your point, so...
Character 1: And then you did the exact same thing at lunch today.
561 Character 2: Okay okay, hold on—that's not the same thing at all. Today was completely different. I wasn't excluding you, I just—Mike asked me a question and I answered it. [scoff] That's literally just having a conversation.
Character 1: Right in front of me. Again.
562 Character 2: You're—come on, you're being kinda unfair here. I can't just not talk to people when you're around. That's not how friendships work, y'know?
Character 1: That's not what this is about.
563 Character 2: Then what—what is it about? Because honestly, I thought we resolved this. I apologized for making you feel left out at the party, and now you're mad that I'm... what, existing normally? [frustrated laugh] I dunno what you want from me.
Character 1: Maybe actually change something instead of just saying you will.
564 Character 2: I am—look look, I am trying, okay? But you're acting like I'm supposed to be perfect immediately. Like, these are habits I've had for years and I'm—I'm working on it, but you gotta give me more than two days.
Character 1: It's been a pattern for months.
565 Character 2: And I didn't—I didn't even know it bothered you until Monday! You never said anything before, so how was I supposed to know? I'm not a mind reader.
Character 1: Shouldn't have to tell you not to make me invisible.
566 Character 2: That's—[sigh] okay, that's dramatic. I never made you invisible. Sometimes I get excited about stuff and I talk over people, yeah, but that's not—it's not personal. I do it to everyone, ask literally anyone.
Character 1: So that makes it okay?
567 Character 2: No! No, that's not what I'm—ugh, you're twisting everything I say. I'm trying to explain that it's not about you specifically, it's just something I gotta work on in general.
Character 1: Sure. Whatever helps you sleep.
568 Character 2: Wow. Okay. So you're just gonna be like this then? Because I'm—I'm really trying here, but you're not giving me anything. You want me to grovel? Is that it?
Character 1: I want you to actually care that you hurt me.
569 Character 2: I do care! But I also—I dunno, I also think you're holding me to this impossible standard where one conversation means I'm suddenly gonna be a completely different person. And that's not—[quieter] that's not really fair either, y'know?

570 SCENARIO: noticing a typo after sending an important email
==================================================

[muttering]
Okay, so that's— that's sent. Great. Um, hopefully Sarah can get back to me about the, uh, the budget thing by— [pause] wait. Wait wait wait.

[slightly panicked]
Did I just— did I just write "form" instead of "from"? Oh no. Oh no no no. Let me just, um, let me just check my sent folder real quick because I swear I— [groan] yeah. Yeah, I did.

[flat]
"I look forward to hearing form you." Form. F-O-R-M. Like a— like a document. [sigh] This is, um, this is exactly the impression I wanted to make with the new client. Super professional. Really, uh, really on top of things.

[faster, working through it]
Okay but maybe— maybe she won't notice? I mean, people make typos all the time, right? It's not like I wrote something completely insane, it's just one letter. One tiny little— 

[resigned]
But it's right there at the end. Like, the very last thing she's gonna read is "form you" instead of "from you." [exhale] Cool. Just, um, just gonna pretend this never happened and hope for the best, I guess.
