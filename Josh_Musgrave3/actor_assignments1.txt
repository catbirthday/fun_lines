You are B; your role: Character 2

Character 1: I heard what happened at Marcus's party.
1 Character 2: Oh god, okay—I was gonna tell you about that. I swear I was gonna tell you today, but I just—I didn't know how to bring it up, y'know?
Character 1: You just stood there.
2 Character 2: No no no, that's not—I mean, okay, yeah, I didn't say anything right away but it wasn't because I agreed with them or anything. I was just... shocked? Like genuinely shocked that they would even say that stuff about you.
Character 1: Right. Shocked.
3 Character 2: I know how it looks. I know, okay? But you gotta understand, there were like fifteen people there and they were all—everyone was talking over each other and I couldn't even—[nervous laugh] I basically froze up like an idiot.
Character 1: They trashed me for twenty minutes, apparently.
4 Character 2: It wasn't twenty—okay, it was... it was bad. You're right. And I should've said something, I should've immediately shut it down but I just... I dunno, I kept thinking someone else would jump in? That's so stupid, I know that's stupid.
Character 1: I would've defended you.
5 Character 2: I know you would've. You always do, and I—god, I'm literally the worst friend. [Sigh] Like I keep replaying it in my head and thinking of all the things I should've said, y'know? All these perfect comebacks that I just... didn't think of in the moment.
Character 1: Did you say anything? Eventually?
6 Character 2: I did! I mean—okay, not right away, but later when it was just me and a few people, I told them they were being ridiculous and that none of that stuff was true. But I know that's not—that's not the same as doing it when everyone was there.
Character 1: No. It's not.
7 Character 2: I really messed up. Like I genuinely, honestly messed up and I don't—I can't even give you a good reason why I didn't speak up. I was scared? Or maybe just... weak? I dunno. [Groan] I hate that I let you down like this.
Character 1: I needed you to have my back.
8 Character 2: You did. You absolutely did, and I failed you. I'm so, so sorry. Like I can't even—there's literally no excuse for what I did. Or didn't do, I guess. Um, is there any way I can make this right? Please?
Character 1: I don't know. Maybe.
9 Character 2: I'll do whatever—seriously, whatever you need. And next time, if there's ever a next time, I promise I'll shut that shit down immediately. Like the second anyone even tries to—I won't freeze up again. I swear I won't.
Character 1: There better not be a next time.
10 Character 2: There won't be. And I mean—I'm gonna make sure everyone knows the truth, okay? I'll talk to each person individually if I have to. I know it doesn't fix what happened, but... I wanna try to make it right. If you'll let me.

Character 1: So. I'm a grandfather now.
11 Character 2: Wait wait wait—what?! Oh my god, when did this happen? I mean, I knew Sarah was pregnant but I thought she wasn't due until like—wasn't it supposed to be next month?
Character 1: Yesterday. 3 AM. Seven pounds, six ounces.
12 Character 2: Yesterday?! And you're just—okay okay, you're telling me now? [Laugh] That's so you, honestly. But like, how are you feeling? This is huge!
Character 1: Strange. I don't feel old enough.
13 Character 2: Oh no no no, you're not old, you're just—I mean, okay, you're a grandpa now which sounds old but like... you're gonna be the cool grandfather, right? The one who like, I dunno, teaches them how to fish or whatever?
Character 1: I don't fish.
14 Character 2: Okay well—you know what I mean though! Like, the fun stuff. Building forts, sneaking them candy when mom's not looking... that whole thing. Have you seen the baby yet?
Character 1: This morning. She has my nose, apparently. Poor kid.
15 Character 2: Stop it—I bet she's gorgeous. Wait, she? It's a girl? What's her name? God, I'm getting like, secondhand excited here and it's not even my grandkid [Chuckle].
Character 1: Emma. After my mother.
16 Character 2: Emma... that's—oh that's really sweet actually. Your mom would've loved that. I mean, she would've been so—sorry, is that okay to say?
Character 1: It's fine. Sarah picked it.
17 Character 2: Sarah's always been thoughtful like that, hasn't she? How's she doing? I mean, labor and everything—was it okay? Not too scary?
Character 1: Twelve hours. Her husband almost passed out twice.
18 Character 2: Twice?! [Gasp] Oh my god, men are so—I mean, no offense but like, she's the one doing all the work and he's the one fainting? That's kinda hilarious actually.
Character 1: He's useless. But he tries.
19 Character 2: Well that's—I guess that's what matters, right? Trying? But seriously though, you're gonna be such a good grandpa. Like, I can already picture you holding little Emma and just... being all soft about it even though you'll pretend you're not.
Character 1: I held her today. She grabbed my finger. Wouldn't let go.
20 Character 2: See? See, I knew it—you're already wrapped around her tiny little finger. That's so—ugh, my heart. You're gonna spoil her rotten, aren't you? Even though you're acting all cool about it right now [Sigh].

Character 1: So the album's out.
21 Character 2: Wait wait wait—WHAT? It dropped? Like, it's actually—oh my god, why didn't you tell me? I've been checking Spotify like every five minutes for the past week!
Character 1: Yeah. Yesterday at midnight.
22 Character 2: And you're just—you're just sitting here like it's nothing? Dude, this is your ALBUM. Your actual album! How are the numbers? Are people—what are they saying?
Character 1: It's doing okay. Better than expected.
23 Character 2: Better than—no no no, I saw the comments. People are literally losing their minds over track three. That one person said it made them cry in their car? [Laugh] That's not "okay," that's incredible!
Character 1: I don't really read those.
24 Character 2: You don't—of course you don't. God, you're so... okay but like, you gotta be feeling something, right? This is huge. Years of work just... out there now.
Character 1: It's weird. Feels like it's not mine anymore.
25 Character 2: Oh. Oh wow, that's—yeah, I guess once it's out there it's kinda... everyone's? That must be so [Sigh] strange, actually. Like watching your kid go to college or something.
Character 1: Something like that. My mom already called twice.
26 Character 2: Of course she did! She's probably—wait, is she playing it for everyone? My mom would literally be at the grocery store with her phone speaker on, like, "my child made this!"
Character 1: She sent me a photo of her book club listening to it.
27 Character 2: Stop—that's actually adorable though. Her book club! I can't even—did they like it? What did they think of all the explicit lyrics on track seven? [Laugh]
Character 1: They said it was "visceral."
28 Character 2: Visceral! Book club ladies calling your music visceral—that's... honestly that might be the best review you're gonna get. Better than any music critic, right?
Character 1: The label wants me to do press now. Interviews and stuff.
29 Character 2: Oh god, you're gonna—you're gonna hate that so much. But like, maybe it won't be terrible? Some of those podcast things are pretty chill, just talking about the process and—wait, are you nervous?
Character 1: I just wanted to make the music. Not explain it.
30 Character 2: Yeah, no, I get that. I totally get that. But hey—the hard part's done, y'know? The album's amazing, people love it, and now you just gotta... let it exist. You did good, babe. Really good.

Character 1: You threw me under the bus with everyone.
31 Character 2: I didn't—okay, I know how it looked, but I genuinely thought you were the one who forgot to lock up. Like, you were the last one there, and I just assumed—
Character 1: You assumed.
32 Character 2: Yeah, I assumed, because that's what made sense at the time! You had the keys, you were closing, and when the manager asked what happened, I just... I mean, what else was I gonna think?
Character 1: You could've asked me first.
33 Character 2: Okay okay, fair, but it's not like I was trying to [scoff] get you in trouble or whatever. I literally thought that's what happened. I wasn't being malicious about it.
Character 1: But you were so sure. In front of everyone.
34 Character 2: Because I—look, I was sure! And yeah, turns out I was wrong, but you're acting like I did this intentionally when I'm telling you, I one hundred percent believed that's how it went down.
Character 1: Must be nice to be wrong with such confidence.
35 Character 2: That's not—come on, that's not fair. I made a mistake, I get that, but I wasn't like, plotting against you or trying to make you look bad. It was just... I dunno, a misunderstanding.
Character 1: A misunderstanding that almost got me fired.
36 Character 2: And I feel terrible about that! I do! But also—[frustrated laugh] you're not exactly letting me make this right. I've tried to explain to everyone that I was wrong, I've tried to fix it—
Character 1: After the damage was done.
37 Character 2: Well yeah, after, because I didn't know I was wrong until after! That's—that's kinda how being wrong works. Look look, I'm sorry it happened, okay? But I can't apologize for something I didn't mean to do.
Character 1: You can apologize for not checking first.
38 Character 2: Fine fine, you're right about that part. I should've—I should've asked you before saying anything. But honestly? You've jumped to conclusions about me before too, so maybe cut me some slack here?
Character 1: This isn't about other times.
39 Character 2: No, but it's about—ugh, never mind. [Sigh] Look, I messed up by not verifying with you first. I own that. But I need you to believe me that I wasn't trying to throw you under any bus.
Character 1: Just did it anyway.
40 Character 2: Yeah. I guess I did. And I'm... I'm sorry for that part, I really am. But I'm also kinda frustrated that you think I'd ever deliberately hurt you like that, y'know? That's what gets me.

Character 1: So I got into that workshop thing.
41 Character 2: Wait wait wait—the one you applied to like, months ago? The one with the—oh my god, the fancy one upstate? You got in?
Character 1: Yeah. Just found out this morning.
42 Character 2: Okay, um, excuse me? This is huge! Like, this is—[Gasp] didn't they only take like fifteen people or something ridiculous? Out of hundreds?
Character 1: Twelve, actually.
43 Character 2: Twelve. You're one of twelve. Do you even—sorry, do you realize how insane that is? Like, you're basically a literary genius now, right?
Character 1: It's just a workshop.
44 Character 2: No no no, don't do that. Don't you dare minimize this. I mean, you've been writing in secret for like—what, three years? And now actual professionals wanna work with you?
Character 1: Two and a half years. And they probably just needed to fill spots.
45 Character 2: Oh my god, stop. Just—stop, okay? They chose you. Out of all those people, they picked your writing. [Softer] That's gotta feel at least a little bit good, right?
Character 1: I guess. It's two weeks away from everything, though.
46 Character 2: Okay but like—that's the point? You get to just, y'know, disappear and write and be around other writers who actually get it. When was the last time you had that?
Character 1: Never.
47 Character 2: Exactly! See? This is—wait, are you nervous? Is that what this is about? Because honestly, I'd be like, completely terrified too.
Character 1: What if I'm the worst one there?
48 Character 2: Um, hello? They literally chose you. But also—[Chuckle] okay, even if you were, which you won't be, isn't that kinda perfect? Like, you'd learn the most?
Character 1: Hadn't thought of it that way.
49 Character 2: Plus you've been saying forever that you need feedback, real feedback. Not just me being like "oh this is amazing" about everything you write—which it is, but y'know.
Character 1: You do say that a lot.
50 Character 2: Because it's true! But now you're gonna get like, actual writers telling you stuff. God, I'm so—I'm actually jealous? But mostly just really, really proud of you.

51 Character 1: [competitive tone] Oh, you're going down tonight, Sarah. [faster] We've been practicing Settlers of Catan for weeks. [Sharp laugh] Tom even built a spreadsheet to track optimal resource combinations—tell them about your probability charts, honey.
Character 2: [dismissively] Spreadsheets? [Snort] How adorable. [in a condescending voice] Mark and I don't need charts when we have pure instinct. We crushed three other couples last month at that tournament—what was it, babe, twelve wins straight?
52 Character 1: [defensive] Those were probably casual players. [muttering] We're talking about real strategy here, not luck. [louder, pointed] Besides, didn't you lose to the Johnsons last week? I heard through the grapevine you rage-quit during Monopoly.
Character 2: [Scoff] [icily] The Johnsons cheated, everyone knows that. [building intensity] And speaking of cheating, remember when Tom "accidentally" knocked over the board when he was losing at Risk? Very convenient timing, wasn't it?
53 Character 1: [Gasp] [indignant] That was completely different! The table was wobbly! [quieter, threatening] You know what, let's just start playing and see who's crying into their wine glass by nine o'clock tonight, shall we?
Character 2: [fake sweet voice] Oh honey, we don't drink and play. [smugly] It keeps our minds sharp—unlike some people who need liquid courage. [Giggle] Mark, set up the board while I grab our lucky dice.
54 Character 1: [sarcastically] Lucky dice? [Bitter laugh] How scientific of you. [mumbling quickly] Tom's algorithm predicted a seventy-three percent win rate for us tonight based on past performance metrics and your tendency to make emotional trades.
Character 2: [slowly, menacingly] Emotional trades? [voice rising] That's rich coming from someone who literally cried over losing Park Place. [Cackle] Mark still has the video on his phone—should we watch it during halftime?
55 Character 1: [through gritted teeth] There is no halftime in Catan! [Exhale] See, this is exactly why we're going to destroy you. [whispered intensely] You don't even know basic board game etiquette, yet you call yourselves competitors.
Character 2: [triumphantly] Etiquette won't save you when I block your longest road. [teasing] What's that face, Tom? [Chuckle] Already realizing your spreadsheet didn't account for psychological warfare? This is going to be easier than expected.
56 Character 1: [nervously] We'll see who's laughing when we control all the wheat. [more confidently] Your weakness has always been resource management, Sarah. [Snicker] Remember Thanksgiving? You traded away three ore for one sheep—one sheep!
Character 2: [angrily] That was strategic! [Hiss] I needed that sheep for the win! [calmer, calculated] Unlike your disaster at New Year's where you built roads to nowhere like some kind of deranged city planner.
57 Character 1: [mock surprise] Oh, we're bringing up New Year's now? [gleefully] Fantastic! Should we discuss how Mark threw the robber at me? [louder] Or how you "accidentally" miscounted your victory points three times?
Character 2: [Deep breath] [controlled fury] Those were honest mistakes. [sarcastically sweet] But hey, if you want to live in the past, that's fine. Mark and I prefer focusing on our current winning streak of seventeen games.
58 Character 1: [skeptically] Seventeen? [Loud laugh] Playing against your parents doesn't count! [smugly] Real competitors play in sanctioned tournaments, which we've actually won, unlike certain people who only play in their living room.
Character 2: [shouting] Sanctioned tournaments? [more quietly, venomous] You placed third out of four teams! [Scornful laugh] The fourth team was literal children! But sure, put that plastic trophy on your mantle, champion.
59 Character 1: [wounded] Those kids were prodigies! [defensively faster] They'd been featured in Board Game Weekly! [Sigh] Whatever, just roll for first placement already. Tom's Excel macro says whoever goes first has the advantage tonight.
Character 2: [mockingly] Excel macro! [Hysterical giggle] [in disbelief] You actually made an Excel macro for family game night? Mark, please tell me we're recording this. The internet needs to see this level of desperate.
60 Character 1: [proudly] It's called preparation! [quieter, intense] Something you'd understand if you took this seriously. [building excitement] When we win tonight, we're posting it everywhere—Facebook, Instagram, your mom's book club group chat, everywhere!
Character 2: [determined whisper] Game on. [normal volume] Mark, get the score pad. [dramatically] By the end of tonight, their precious spreadsheets will be nothing but deleted files of shame and regret. Let's teach them how real champions play.

61 Customer Support: [calmly] I understand this is an emergency, sir. [reassuring] Let me pull up the next available slot. [professionally] Can you give me your address and account number, if you have it?
Character 1: [frustrated] It's 4782 Maple Drive—M-A-P-L-E—unit B! [more urgently] The account number is... [groans] somewhere in this mess, maybe KL-45892? [exasperated] Just send someone immediately!
62 Customer Support: [apologetically] I'm checking our system now, Mr... [pause] Johnson, is it? [more firmly] Our earliest emergency slot is at 2:30 PM, but there's a, um, hundred-fifty dollar emergency surcharge.
Character 1: [outraged] Two-thirty?! [incredulous] That's four hours away! [shouting louder] My vintage wine collection—worth twelve thousand dollars—is literally drowning down there right now!
63 Customer Support: [sympathetically] I completely understand your frustration. [hopeful] Let me check if tech number 47 can reroute—he's finishing at 1245 Oak Street. [cautiously] Would you be willing to pay the premium rate of $275?
Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh sure, just rob me while I'm drowning! [defeated sigh] Fine, whatever, just—[desperately] can't you people move any faster? This is destroying everything I own!
64 Customer Support: [relieved] Perfect, I've secured Tony, badge ID T-9847. [more confidently] He'll arrive between 12:45 and 1:15 PM. [helpfully] Meanwhile, shut off your main water valve—it's usually near the water heater.
Character 1: [exasperated] I already did that twenty minutes ago! [angrily] The damage is done—my mother's antique rugs, gone! [more quietly] This is... this is a complete disaster, you understand?
65 Customer Support: [empathetically] I'm truly sorry about your belongings, Mr. Johnson. [professionally] Tony will call from 555-0199 when he's ten minutes away. [reassuring tone] He's our best emergency specialist—eighteen years experience with floods.
Character 1: [skeptical] Your "best" better be incredible because I'm calling my insurance—policy number HG-7734521—right after this. [threateningly] If this isn't fixed properly, you'll hear from my lawyer!
66 Customer Support: [calmly] That's completely understandable, sir. [more seriously] Tony will document everything with photos for your claim. [helpful] Do you need our insurance liaison contact? It's extension 4455.
Character 1: [sighs heavily] Yeah, fine, whatever helps. [worried] The water's still rising somehow—it's coming through the, the foundation cracks! [urgently] Are you absolutely sure he can handle this?
67 Customer Support: [confidently] Tony handles three to four floods weekly, especially in your ZIP code, 44126. [reassuring] He'll bring our heavy-duty pump, model XP-500. [warmly] You're in excellent hands, I promise.
Character 1: [slightly calmer] Okay, okay, I'll try to... salvage what I can. [frustrated grunt] This old house—built in 1952—just keeps having problems! [resigned] Should've moved years ago.
68 Customer Support: [sympathetically] Older homes can be challenging, absolutely. [helpfully] Tony specializes in vintage properties actually. [more positively] He'll assess if you need our waterproofing service—warranty code WP-2024—to prevent future issues.
Character 1: [exhausted] Just... make sure he gets here by 1:15, not a minute later. [firmly] I'm losing thousands by the hour here! [softer] Sorry for yelling, I'm just... stressed.
69 Customer Support: [understanding] No apology needed—this is incredibly stressful! [reassuringly] I've marked your case as priority one, reference number EM-78234. [warmly] Tony will take excellent care of you, Mr. Johnson.
Character 1: [resigned] Alright, I'll be waiting by the door. [muttering] Unit B, side entrance, green door—he can't miss it. [sighs] This day just couldn't get any worse.

71 Customer Support: [briskly] Good afternoon, Valley Medical Labs, this is Sarah speaking. [more quickly] How can I help you today—do you have a patient ID number ready?
Character 1: [frustrated] Yes, it's 4-7-2-9-6, and I've been waiting for my blood work for two weeks now. [sighs heavily] My doctor said it would be three days, maybe five at most.
72 Customer Support: [apologetically] Let me just... pull that up for you right away. [pause] [more concerned] Oh, I see there's been a delay with your lipid panel—looks like the sample needed to be re-run.
Character 1: [incredulous] Re-run? Nobody called me about this! [getting louder] I've been checking my patient portal every single day, refreshing it like... like I'm waiting for concert tickets or something.
73 Customer Support: [quickly] I completely understand your frustration, and you're absolutely right—someone should have contacted you. [more firmly] The system shows a notification was sent, but, um, sometimes those get caught in spam filters.
Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh great, so my health results are sitting in spam next to Nigerian prince emails. [groans] When exactly will I get these results then?
74 Customer Support: [reassuring] The good news is the re-test was completed yesterday morning. [speaking faster] Your results should be uploaded within twenty-four to forty-eight hours, definitely by Thursday at the latest.
Character 1: [skeptically] Should be? Or will be? [pause] [more urgently] Because I have a follow-up appointment Friday, and if I don't have these numbers, the whole visit is basically pointless.
75 Customer Support: [more confidently] I'm putting a priority flag on your file right now—actually, let me... [briskly] I'm sending a direct message to the lab supervisor to expedite this for your Friday appointment.
Character 1: [slightly calmer] Well, that's... that's something at least. [sighs] Can you guarantee I'll have them by Thursday evening, though?
76 Customer Support: [carefully] While I can't make absolute promises, the priority flag means your results jump to the front of the queue. [more enthusiastically] In my experience, these usually process within twelve hours once flagged.
Character 1: [resigned] Fine, I'll... I'll wait another day. [more firmly] But if they're not there by Thursday noon, I'm calling back and asking for you specifically, Sarah.
77 Customer Support: [warmly] Please do ask for me—I'll be here nine to five. [quickly] I'm also adding my direct extension to your file notes, it's 2-2-4.
Character 1: [surprised] Oh, that's actually really helpful. [pause] [more appreciatively] Sorry for getting snippy earlier, I'm just stressed about these cholesterol numbers, you know?
78 Customer Support: [understanding] No apologies needed—waiting for health results is incredibly stressful. [more gently] We see it every day, and honestly, two weeks is unacceptable for a standard panel.
Character 1: [curiously] Does this happen often? The whole re-running thing? [more concerned] Because now I'm wondering if the results will even be accurate.
79 Customer Support: [reassuringly] It's actually quite rare, maybe one in two hundred samples. [speaking faster] Usually it's due to temperature issues during transport or, occasionally, insufficient sample volume—but the re-test results are completely reliable.
Character 1: [relieved] Okay, that's... that makes me feel a bit better. [chuckles nervously] I was imagining them just losing my blood somewhere in a giant warehouse of tubes.
80 Customer Support: [laughing gently] I promise we're much more organized than that! [briskly] Is there anything else I can help with while I have your file open—update contact information, anything like that?
Character 1: [decisively] No, I think we're good. [more hopefully] I'll just keep refreshing that portal and, um, hopefully see those results pop up soon—fingers crossed for tomorrow.
