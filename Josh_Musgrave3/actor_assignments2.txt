Character 1: So. I got in.
101 Character 2: Got in? Got in where? Wait—oh my god, are you talking about... did you hear back from—no no no, you're kidding me right now!
Character 1: Stanford. Yeah.
102 Character 2: STANFORD? Are you—okay okay okay, I'm trying to be calm but like [Gasp] that's literally your dream school! Since, what, like sophomore year? This is huge!
Character 1: I keep checking the email. Making sure it's real.
103 Character 2: No, I totally get that. Like when something this big happens, your brain just kinda... doesn't compute? But babe, it's real—you did it! How are you even feeling right now?
Character 1: Terrified, mostly.
104 Character 2: Wait, terrified? Of—oh. Oh yeah, no that's... honestly that makes total sense. It's like, you work so hard for something and then when you actually get it, it's kinda overwhelming, right?
Character 1: What if I can't handle it?
105 Character 2: Okay, no—stop. You're gonna handle it because you're literally the smartest person I know and they chose YOU. Out of like, what, thousands of people? [Softer] They saw something in you, y'know?
Character 1: My parents don't know yet.
106 Character 2: You haven't—wait, you haven't told them? But they're gonna be so... actually, are you worried about their reaction or something?
Character 1: They wanted me to stay local. Community college, then transfer.
107 Character 2: Oh. Oh man, that's—yeah that's complicated. I mean, they probably just want you close but like... this is Stanford we're talking about. You can't just—you can't pass that up.
Character 1: It's expensive.
108 Character 2: Right, yeah, the money thing is... [Sigh] okay that's real. But don't they have like, financial aid and scholarships and stuff? You're basically a genius, so...
Character 1: Maybe. I don't know. Everything's moving too fast.
109 Character 2: Hey, hey—it's okay to just... sit with this for a minute, y'know? Like you don't have to figure out every single detail today. You got into freaking Stanford! Can we at least celebrate that part?
Character 1: I guess. Want to get tacos?
110 Character 2: Tacos? You just—okay yes, absolutely yes. We're getting tacos and you're gonna tell me everything about that acceptance letter because I wanna hear every single word. This is amazing—you're amazing.

You are B; your role: Character 2

Character 1: Last round was yesterday.
111 Character 2: Oh my god, wait—you're done? Like done done? That's—holy shit, I can't believe it's actually over. How are you feeling right now?
Character 1: Tired. Really tired.
112 Character 2: Yeah, no, of course you are. I mean, your body just went through like—basically a war, y'know? Do you wanna, um, celebrate somehow or are you more just... processing?
Character 1: I don't know what to do with myself.
113 Character 2: That's so—yeah, that makes total sense actually. You've been in treatment mode for what, like six months? And now suddenly it's just... [Sigh] normal life again? That's gotta be weird.
Character 1: Seven months. Feels longer.
114 Character 2: Seven months of—god, I literally cannot imagine. Are the doctors happy with how everything went at least? Like, are they optimistic?
Character 1: They say it went well. We'll see.
115 Character 2: Okay but that's—that's good news, right? I mean, doctors don't just say that to be nice. They're like, professionally obligated to be realistic about this stuff.
Character 1: I guess. Still have scans in three months.
116 Character 2: Right, right, the whole monitoring thing. That's gotta be—ugh, the waiting must be absolutely brutal. [Softer] But hey, you made it through the hardest part already.
Character 1: Have I? This feels pretty hard.
117 Character 2: Oh babe, I didn't mean—shit, you're right. I'm sorry. The after part is probably its own kind of difficult, huh? Like everyone expects you to just bounce back?
Character 1: My mom bought me a wig yesterday. For when it grows back weird.
118 Character 2: Wait wait wait—for when it grows back? Not for now? That's actually kinda sweet though, like she's already thinking ahead to—oh, does it really grow back different?
Character 1: Apparently. Might come in curly. I've always had straight hair.
119 Character 2: Okay that's—[Laugh] sorry, but imagine you with curls! That could be kinda fun actually? Like a whole new look without even trying. Very post-metamorphosis vibes, y'know?
Character 1: Sure. New hair, new me. Very inspiring.
120 Character 2: Hey, I know you're being sarcastic but honestly? You've earned the right to be whatever version of yourself you wanna be now. Curly, straight, bald—you're still gonna be amazing.

Character 1: You said you'd help me move. Three weeks ago.
121 Character 2: Oh god, I—I completely forgot. No wait, that's not—I didn't forget, I just... something came up and then I meant to text you but I got distracted and—[groan] I'm the worst friend ever.
Character 1: This isn't the first time.
122 Character 2: I know, I know, you're right. It's like—it's becoming a pattern, isn't it? The concert tickets, the job reference thing, now this... I don't mean to do this, I swear I don't.
Character 1: But you do. Every single time.
123 Character 2: That's—yeah. Yeah, you're right. I just... I get overwhelmed? Like I wanna help, I really really do, and then life gets crazy and I—I drop the ball. [nervous laugh] Every time, apparently.
Character 1: I hired movers. Cost me four hundred dollars.
124 Character 2: Four hundred—oh my god. Okay, I'm paying you back. No no no, don't argue, I'm literally sending you the money right now. Where's my phone—wait, it's right here. I'm doing it now, see? Not later, now.
Character 1: Sure you are.
125 Character 2: No, look—look, I'm opening Venmo right now. What's—actually you know what? I'm gonna add extra for being such a flake. Five hundred. There, sending... sent. Check your phone.
Character 1: You actually did it.
126 Character 2: I mean, yeah? It's literally the least I can do. And I'm—I'm gonna work on this, okay? The whole not following through thing. Maybe I need like a planner or—or reminders on my phone or something.
Character 1: You've said that before too.
127 Character 2: No, I—[sigh] you're right. I have. But this time I'm gonna—wait, that sounds like BS too, doesn't it? Um, what if you help me? Like, hold me accountable?
Character 1: Why should I?
128 Character 2: Because I—because you're my best friend and I'm scared of losing you? And I know I don't deserve another chance but I'm asking anyway because honestly, you matter to me more than I've been showing.
Character 1: I'm tired of being disappointed.
129 Character 2: I know. God, I know you are, and that's—that's on me. Completely on me. I just... I wanna be better, y'know? For you, for us, for... I dunno, for myself too, I guess.
Character 1: Start small. Just... text me when plans change. That's all I ask.
130 Character 2: Yes. Yes, absolutely. I can do that—I will do that. And um, thank you. For not just walking away. I know you could've and honestly, I wouldn't have blamed you if you did.

Character 1: You just sat there.
131 Character 2: I know, I—fuck, I'm sorry. I should've said something, I just... the whole thing happened so fast and I kinda froze? That's not an excuse though, I know that's not—
Character 1: They were completely wrong about me.
132 Character 2: They were! They absolutely were, and I—I knew it too. In my head I was like screaming all these things I wanted to say but then nothing came out? [nervous laugh] God, I'm such a coward.
Character 1: Yeah.
133 Character 2: I deserve that. No no, I totally deserve that. You needed me and I just... sat there like an idiot. I kept thinking I'd jump in at the right moment but then—then it was over and you'd already left.
Character 1: The right moment was immediately.
134 Character 2: You're right. You're completely right. I should've—the second they started going after you, I should've been like "hey, that's bullshit" but I just... I dunno, I hate confrontation and that's such a stupid excuse because you're my friend and that should matter more than—
Character 1: Do you even agree with me? Or them?
135 Character 2: What? No! No no no, of course I agree with you! I would never—Jesus, is that what you think? That I was on their side? [groan] I wasn't, I swear I wasn't. I was just being a shitty friend who couldn't—who didn't speak up when it mattered.
Character 1: Sure looked like you agreed with them.
136 Character 2: I know how it looked. God, I keep replaying it and I'm like... why didn't I just say something? Literally anything would've been better than silence, right? I mean, silence basically is agreement, isn't it? Fuck, I really messed up.
Character 1: I felt completely alone in there.
137 Character 2: I'm so—that breaks my heart, honestly. You shouldn't have had to defend yourself alone. That's what friends are for, y'know? To have your back when people are being assholes. And I didn't do that. I failed at like, the most basic friend thing.
Character 1: Why didn't you say anything? Really.
138 Character 2: I was scared, okay? [sigh] That's the ugly truth. I was scared they'd turn on me too and I just—I couldn't handle it. Which is so selfish because you were literally handling it alone while I was worried about myself.
Character 1: I would've backed you up. You know that, right?
139 Character 2: I know. I know you would've, you always do. That's what makes this worse actually—you've literally never let anyone talk shit about me, ever. And the one time you needed me to do the same, I just... didn't. I'm gonna—I'm gonna talk to them tomorrow, set the record straight.
Character 1: You don't have to do that now. It's done.
140 Character 2: No but I want to—I need to. Not just for you but for me too? Like, I gotta prove to myself that I'm not just gonna be this person who stays quiet when things matter. Next time—and I swear there will be a next time—I've got your back. No freezing, no excuses. I promise.

Character 1: We need to talk about Jordan.
141 Character 2: Oh god, okay—I know, I know what you're gonna say. I've been bringing them everywhere lately and I—I get it if that's been too much.
Character 1: Too much? That's one way to put it.
142 Character 2: Wait wait wait, just let me—[nervous laugh] okay, I know they can be a lot sometimes. They're just really excited about meeting my friends and I didn't wanna hurt their feelings by leaving them out, y'know?
Character 1: Every. Single. Time.
143 Character 2: I know! I know, and that's—that's not fair to you guys. I just, um, I guess I didn't realize how often it was happening until—well, until now basically.
Character 1: They interrupted my story four times last night. Four.
144 Character 2: Oh my god, they did? I'm so—I'm so sorry. They do that sometimes when they're nervous and I should've said something. I definitely should've stepped in. [sigh] That's on me.
Character 1: And the week before? Made everything about them.
145 Character 2: Yeah, the—the thing about their job promotion, right? For like twenty minutes? I know I know, that was brutal. I literally tried to change the subject but they just kept going and I didn't know how to—I mean, I couldn't just tell them to stop talking in front of everyone.
Character 1: You could've not brought them.
146 Character 2: You're right. You're absolutely right and I—god, I feel like such an idiot. I just wanted them to feel included but I wasn't thinking about how it was affecting you guys.
Character 1: It's supposed to be our friend time.
147 Character 2: I know. And I've been—I've been ruining that, haven't I? Like, we used to have such good conversations and now it's all... different. Because of me. Because I keep bringing them without even asking if it's okay.
Character 1: Yeah. You have.
148 Character 2: I'm gonna—I'm gonna fix this, okay? From now on, friend nights are just friends. No partners. I promise. And honestly, I think Jordan needs to understand that I need my own space too, y'know? [quieter] I've kinda been avoiding that conversation.
Character 1: They're not a bad person. They're just... a lot.
149 Character 2: No no, I get it. They really are—they're intense and they don't always read the room and that's... that's something we're working on actually. But that doesn't mean you guys should have to deal with it all the time.
Character 1: I miss how things used to be. Just us.
150 Character 2: Me too. Me too, honestly. And I'm—I'm really sorry I let it get this bad. Next week, just us? Pizza and bad movies like we used to do? I swear, no Jordan. Just... just us again.

--- FULL SCRIPT ---
151 Character 1: [shaky voice] I got the job offer yesterday. [Deep breath] It's in Seattle—the position I've dreamed about for years. [voice breaking] But I can't imagine leaving you, leaving everything we've built here together since college.
Character 2: [stunned whisper] Seattle? That's... that's three thousand miles away. [voice cracking] When would you leave? [Choking sob] God, I knew this day might come, but I kept pushing it out of my mind completely.
152 Character 1: [through tears] They want me there by next month. [quivering] I haven't even said yes yet because every time I try, I picture your face. [Gasping breath] Remember when we promised we'd be each other's maids of honor?
Character 2: [bitter laugh] Of course I remember—we were drunk on cheap wine in your apartment. [more shakily] We planned our whole futures that night. [voice dropping] This wasn't supposed to happen until we were at least thirty-five, remember?
153 Character 1: [pleading tone] You could come with me! [desperately faster] There are tons of marketing jobs in Seattle, and we could get a place together like we always talked about. [Sniffling] Please, just think about it for a second.
Character 2: [firm but sad] My whole family is here, Sarah's here, my job... [trailing off] I can't just uproot everything. [Shuddering breath] But I can't ask you to give up your dream either. This is so unfair.
154 Character 1: [angry suddenly] Why does growing up have to mean growing apart? [louder] This is exactly what happened to my sister and her best friend! [Bitter sob] I swore I'd never let distance destroy us like that, ever.
Character 2: [gentle whisper] Hey, we're not them. [steadier] We've survived your terrible boyfriends, my parents' divorce, that whole disaster with the apartment flood. [warmly through tears] Geography can't break what we have—I won't let it destroy us.
155 Character 1: [laughing while crying] Remember when we got matching tattoos and swore we'd live next door forever? [nostalgic tone] God, we were so naive. [Hiccupping sob] I'm going to miss our Tuesday wine nights more than anything else.
Character 2: [determined] Then we'll have virtual wine nights. [building confidence] Every Tuesday, no exceptions, same terrible reality shows. [voice wavering] And I'll visit so often they'll think I live there. [Soft laugh] You're not getting rid of me.
156 Character 1: [relieved exhale] You really mean that? Even with the time difference and everything? [hopeful whisper] I've been so scared to tell you because I thought you'd hate me. [quickly] I've been carrying this secret for three days.
Character 2: [mock offended] Hate you? [more seriously] I could never hate you, you absolute idiot. [thick with emotion] I'm devastated and proud and terrified all at once. [Watery chuckle] But mostly I'm just going to miss your stupid face.
157 Character 1: [sobbing harder] Stop being so supportive, you're making this worse! [laughing through tears] I had a whole speech prepared about how we'd stay close. [softer] But you already know we will, don't you? You always know everything.
Character 2: [teasing weakly] Well, someone has to be the smart one. [more vulnerable] Promise me you won't replace me with some cool Seattle hipster. [trembling] I know they have better coffee there, but our friendship is irreplaceable, right?
158 Character 1: [incredulous] Replace you? [louder and firm] You're literally tattooed on my ankle, you weirdo! [dropping to whisper] No one else would understand our synchronized period cry sessions or our elaborate revenge plots. You're stuck with me forever, distance be damned.
Character 2: [breathless giggle] Good, because I already bought a plane ticket for your first weekend there. [matter-of-fact] Non-refundable. [Snorting laugh] I figured you'd need help decorating and someone to ugly-cry with while you unpack all our photos together.
159 Character 1: [overwhelmed] You already bought a ticket? [voice rising] Before I even accepted the job? [Soft sob] This is why I love you, you beautiful, presumptuous person. Of course you knew I'd take it before I did.
Character 2: [proudly sad] Someone had to push you toward your dreams when you're too scared. [quieter] That's what best friends do. [Long exhale] Plus, I needed something concrete to hold onto, proof that this isn't really goodbye forever.
160 Character 1: [whimpering] Come here, I need the biggest hug. [muffled against shoulder] We're going to make this work. [fiercely] Long distance friendship is nothing compared to what we've already survived. Seattle doesn't stand a chance against us, I promise.
Character 2: [crying freely] I'm going to miss you so much it physically hurts already. [stronger] But I'm also so ridiculously proud. [whispered promise] You're going to conquer that city, and I'll be cheering from here until I visit.

Character 1: [groggy] Hello, is this... uh... Relaxation Plus on Highway 42? [yawns] I bought your model ZX-9000 last month, order number R45-2891, and [confused] honestly, I can't figure out half these buttons.
161 Customer Support: [cheerfully] Good afternoon! Yes, this is Relaxation Plus. [sympathetic] I completely understand the ZX-9000 can be overwhelming at first. [warmly] Let me pull up your account—R45-2891, perfect—what specific features are giving you trouble?
Character 1: [sluggishly] Well, there's this... um... "shiatsu mode 3" thing? [sighs heavily] And something called neural wave therapy at setting 7-B. [bewildered] The manual just shows pictures of happy people, no actual instructions.
162 Customer Support: [reassuring] Oh, those are actually our premium features! [enthusiastically] Shiatsu mode 3 targets your lumbar region with—let's see—approximately 14 pressure points. [more slowly] Neural wave therapy uses rhythmic pulses, kind of like... ocean waves, but for your spine.
Character 1: [drowsily] Ocean waves? [perking up slightly] Wait, is that why there's a button labeled "Pacific" next to "Atlantic"? [mumbles] I pressed Atlantic once and felt like I was being kneaded by... I don't know... an aggressive dolphin.
163 Customer Support: [chuckles] That's actually a great description! [informatively] Atlantic mode operates at 65 RPM with deeper compression—code AT-550 in your settings. [gentler] Pacific is more subtle, about 40 RPM, perfect for when you're feeling, well, benumbed like now.
Character 1: [wearily] Speaking of settings, what's this—hold on—[frustrated] "Memory slot A through F" business? [groans] Do I need to remember six different massage combinations, because honestly, I can barely remember my zip code, 94107.
164 Customer Support: [laughing softly] No, no, the chair remembers for you! [excitedly] You can save your favorite combinations—pressure level, heat intensity, even the foot roller speed. [helpfully] Most customers use slot A for morning wake-up, maybe slot B for post-workout at intensity level 8.
Character 1: [more alert] Oh! That actually sounds... useful. [hesitantly] But there's this weird vibration at frequency—um—the display says 12.5 Hz? [concerned] Is it supposed to make my teeth feel tingly, or should I call that warranty number, 1-800-MASSAGE?
165 Customer Support: [calmly] The 12.5 Hz setting is completely normal—that's our patented VibroCalm technology. [more seriously] However, teeth tingling means you might have the headrest position too high. [instructively] Try lowering it about 2 inches using lever L-4 on your right side.

166 Customer Support: [briskly] Good afternoon, this is Allied Loan Services, how can I— [quickly] I see you're calling about payment posting. [more warmly] Let me pull up your account right away, what's your loan number?
Character 1: [frustrated] It's 4-4-7-2-9-1. [sighs heavily] Look, I made a payment ten days ago and it's still not showing. [voice breaking] I can't afford another late fee when I actually paid on time.
167 Customer Support: [rapidly] I see the account here, let me just— [pause] [more carefully] Yes, I show a pending payment from the 15th. [apologetically] Sometimes our system takes up to, um, fourteen business days to fully process.
Character 1: [outraged] Fourteen days?! [voice rising] My credit score is tanking because you guys can't— [exhales sharply] How is this even legal? The money left my bank account immediately!
168 Customer Support: [defensive] Sir, I understand your frustration, but the processing time is clearly stated in your loan agreement. [more quickly] Page twelve, section four-B. [softer] Would you like me to expedite this with my supervisor?
Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh, page twelve, of course. [groans] Yes, please get your supervisor because this is— [desperately] I'm drowning here and you're quoting paperwork at me.
169 Customer Support: [hurriedly] Actually, wait, I'm seeing something here. [confused] Did you... did you send the payment to our old processing center? [more gently] We switched banks last month, sent out notices.
Character 1: [quietly] What notices? [increasingly panicked] I never got any— are you saying my payment went to the wrong place? [voice cracking] Where's my money then?
170 Customer Support: [speaking quickly] The payment will bounce back to your account within five to seven— [catching themselves] [more slowly] I mean, it's safe, don't worry. [reassuringly] We can waive the late fee once it's resolved.
Character 1: [bitter laugh] Once it's resolved? [exhausted] My landlord doesn't care about your processing errors. [pleading] Can't you just mark it as received since you know I paid?
171 Customer Support: [sympathetically] I wish I could, I really do. [more firmly] But the system won't let me override without the actual funds. [quickly] Let me create a case number for you, okay?
Character 1: [defeated] A case number. [sighs] That's your solution? [more forcefully] I've got three kids and we might lose our apartment because of your "system."
172 Customer Support: [uncomfortably] Sir, I— [pause] [more determined] You know what, hold on. [typing rapidly] I'm flagging this as urgent hardship, that should escalate it within twenty-four hours instead.
Character 1: [skeptically] Twenty-four hours. [hollow laugh] You people always say that. [quietly] Last time someone promised that, it took three weeks and multiple calls.
173 Customer Support: [earnestly] This is different, I'm putting my employee ID on it. [speaking faster] My direct extension is 4-5-5-1, ask for Marcus. [firmly] I'll personally track this tomorrow morning.
Character 1: [surprised] You're actually— [pause] [cautiously hopeful] Marcus? [sighs] Okay, I'm writing this down. But if this doesn't work...
174 Customer Support: [confidently] It will work. [more quietly] Between you and me, I've seen this exact issue before. [quickly] The old bank still forwards payments, just slowly. Should hit by tomorrow afternoon.
Character 1: [wearily] I want to believe you, Marcus. [emotionally] But I've been calling you guys for two weeks and everyone says something different. [resigned] I just need this nightmare to end.
175 Customer Support: [gently] I've noted everything in your file. [more assertively] When you call tomorrow, even if you don't reach me, any agent will see the urgent flag. [reassuringly] We'll get this sorted, I promise.
Character 1: [quietly] Alright. [pause] [slightly warmer] Thank you for actually listening, Marcus. [exhausted] Most agents just read scripts at me. I'll call tomorrow.
