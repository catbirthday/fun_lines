Character 1: We need to talk about the dating thing.
156 Character 2: Oh my god, are you—are you seriously mad about that? I was just trying to help! You've been saying you're ready to get back out there, so I thought—I dunno, I thought you'd appreciate it.
Character 1: I never said that.
157 Character 2: You literally did! Last month at Casey's thing, you were like "maybe it's time" and I—look, if you didn't mean it, fine, but don't act like I'm making this up.
Character 1: One comment. At a party. While drunk.
158 Character 2: Okay okay, but it's not just that. You're always—[sigh] you're always talking about how everyone's paired off and you're the only single one, so excuse me for thinking you wanted to change that.
Character 1: So you decided to fix me?
159 Character 2: That's not—come on, that's not what I'm doing. I'm trying to be a good friend! Like, sorry for caring about your happiness, I guess?
Character 1: This isn't about my happiness.
160 Character 2: Then what's it about? Because from where I'm standing, you're—you're getting upset at me for literally just introducing you to people. That's what friends do!
Character 1: Every. Single. Time. We go out.
161 Character 2: That's... okay that's an exaggeration and you know it. Maybe like, three times? Four? [frustrated laugh] And honestly, you seemed into it with Alex, so I don't get why you're suddenly—
Character 1: You don't get to decide when I'm ready.
162 Character 2: I'm not deciding anything! I'm just—ugh, I'm creating opportunities, that's all. You can say no. You have said no! Multiple times! And I've been fine with it!
Character 1: Have you? Because you keep doing it.
163 Character 2: Yeah, because I thought—look look, maybe I misread things, okay? But you gotta understand, watching you be miserable and lonely is really hard, and I'm just trying to—
Character 1: Lonely? Is that what you think?
164 Character 2: I mean... yeah? Kinda? You literally never wanna go home after we hang out, you're always texting at like 2am about feeling disconnected, so I—I dunno what else to call it. [scoff] But apparently trying to help makes me the bad guy.
Character 1: Being single doesn't mean I'm broken.
165 Character 2: I never said you were broken! Jesus, you're really—you're twisting everything I say. I'm sorry if I pushed too hard, alright? But maybe, just maybe, you could've just talked to me about it instead of... whatever this is.

Script: 813fb8e0_script | Role: Character 2 (B)

Character 1: You didn't show up Saturday.
166 Character 2: Wait, what? Saturday? I mean—nobody told me it was definitely happening. Last I heard you guys were still figuring out if you were even gonna do anything.
Character 1: Everyone else made it.
167 Character 2: Okay okay, but how was I supposed to know? You said "maybe we'll do something" like two weeks ago and then—[scoff]—literally nothing after that. I'm not a mind reader.
Character 1: You could've asked.
168 Character 2: I could've—seriously? That's not how invites work. You don't just assume you're invited to something nobody actually invited you to. That's like, presumptuous or whatever.
Character 1: So you just forgot about it.
169 Character 2: No! I didn't forget, I just—I didn't think it was real. There was no time, no place, no "hey we're definitely doing this." You're acting like I deliberately skipped it when I didn't even know it was happening. [frustrated laugh]
Character 1: Everyone else figured it out.
170 Character 2: Yeah well maybe everyone else got actual information? I dunno, maybe I'm just not in the loop anymore. Is that—is that what this is about?
Character 1: That's not what I said.
171 Character 2: But that's kinda what it feels like. Look look, I'm sorry I wasn't there, okay? But I'm also a little—you could've just texted me. One text. "Hey, Saturday's on." That's all.
Character 1: I shouldn't have to.
172 Character 2: What does that even mean? We're friends, not—I'm not psychic. If you want me somewhere, just tell me. I literally always show up when I know about stuff.
Character 1: Do you though?
173 Character 2: Oh come on, that's—[sigh]—that's not fair and you know it. Name one time I've bailed when I actually knew something was happening. One time.
Character 1: I can't keep chasing you down for every single thing.
174 Character 2: Nobody's asking you to chase me down! I'm asking for like, basic communication. A text, a call, literally anything that says "this is happening" instead of "maybe we'll do something."
Character 1: Fine. Next time I'll spell it out.
175 Character 2: That's—okay, you're being sarcastic, but honestly? Yeah. Please do. Because apparently I'm the only one who needs actual words to know plans are real, and I'm kinda tired of feeling like the bad friend here when I genuinely didn't know.

176 SCENARIO: debating whether to wave back at someone who might not be waving at them
==================================================

[uncertain]
Oh. Oh wait, is that— are they waving at me? I think— I think they're waving. But, um, but they could be waving at, like, literally anyone behind me, right? [nervous laugh] There's probably, uh, there's probably someone right behind me.

[muttering quickly]
Okay, so do I wave back? Because if I wave and they're not— if they're not actually waving at me, then I'm just, um, I'm just some weirdo waving at nothing. Which is— which is not great.

[slightly panicked]
But if they ARE waving at me and I don't wave back, then I'm, uh, I'm rude. I'm the rude person who ignores people. [exhale] God, why is this— why is this so complicated?

[thinking out loud]
I mean, I could do like a half-wave? Like a, um, like a little tentative wave that could maybe pass as just, uh, just adjusting my hair or something if it goes wrong?

[resigned]
Okay, okay, I'm just— I'm just gonna do it. Quick little wave. [pause] There. Done. And they're... yeah, they're waving back. So we're good. We're, um, we're all good here.

177 Character 1: [whining] I don't want broccoli! [louder] It looks like tiny trees and trees are yucky! [crossing arms sound] Why can't I just have cookies for dinner? [pleading] Pleeease mommy, just this one time, I promise I'll eat vegetables tomorrow!
Character 2: [exhausted sigh] Sweetheart, you said that yesterday. [firmly] And the day before. [more sternly] You need to eat real food to grow big and strong. Look, I'll put cheese on it—you love cheese, remember?
178 Character 1: [suspicious] Cheese won't make it better. [dramatically] The green is still there hiding underneath! [fake crying] My tummy says no thank you! [whispered confession] Maybe if you made it into dinosaur shapes? But probably not even then.
Character 2: [forced cheerfulness] How about we make it a game? [encouraging tone] One bite for Superman, one for Batman! [desperately] I'll even let you watch cartoons while eating. Please, just three tiny bites—that's all I'm asking for tonight.
179 Character 1: [negotiating] Only if I get ice cream after. [quickly] And not the healthy kind with fruit! [stubbornly] Real chocolate ice cream with sprinkles on top. [mumbling] And maybe then I'll think about possibly considering eating one microscopic piece.
Character 2: [frustrated growl] No dessert until vegetables! [more controlled] That's the rule and you know it. [pleading now] Other kids eat their veggies without all this drama. Don't you want to be a big kid like cousin Emma?
180 Character 1: [offended gasp] Emma is weird! [tattling voice] She eats salad for fun! [disgusted] That's not normal, mommy. [matter-of-factly] I think her taste buds might be broken or something. Mine work perfectly—that's why vegetables taste so terrible.
Character 2: [laughing despite frustration] Your taste buds aren't special detectives. [sarcastically] They're just picky. [softer now] Remember when you hated pizza? Now you beg for it every Friday. Sometimes we need to try things multiple times.
181 Character 1: [thoughtful humming] Pizza is different though. [excitedly] It has cheese and bread and yummy red sauce! [back to whining] Broccoli is just... green. [dramatically flopping] Nothing good has ever been green except maybe green lollipops!
Character 2: [deep breath] What about green apples? [hopefully] You love those! And green grapes? [more animated] Green gummy bears are your favorite! See, green foods can be delicious when you give them a proper chance.
182 Character 1: [considering] Those don't count! [defensively] They're fruit and candy, not vegetables. [brightening suddenly] Wait, if you blend the broccoli into a smoothie with lots of berries, [calculating] then technically I wouldn't taste it, right?
Character 2: [surprised] That's... actually not terrible. [cautiously optimistic] We could try that tomorrow. [more firmly] But tonight, these are already cooked. Two bites of regular broccoli now, [negotiating tone] and tomorrow we'll make your special smoothie.
183 Character 1: [heavy sigh] Fiiiiine. [dramatically] But I need ketchup. [demanding] Lots and lots of ketchup! [warning tone] And if I throw up, it's your fault and you have to clean it all by yourself, okay?
Character 2: [wearily] Deal. [relieved exhale] Here comes the ketchup bottle. [muttering] Whatever works at this point. I'm choosing my battles here, and if ketchup on broccoli means nutrients in your body, [resigned] then so be it.
184 Character 1: [chewing reluctantly] It's... [surprised] not the worst thing ever. [suspiciously] Did you do something different? [accusingly] You tricked me somehow! This tastes like... almost like real food that humans could eat without dying!
Character 2: [victorious laugh] See? [warmly] I told you it wasn't poison! [encouragingly] That's my brave little eater right there. One more bite and you've kept your promise. Then we can read your favorite bedtime story.
185 Character 1: [mouth full] Can we read two stories? [swallowing] Since I'm being so brave? [proudly] I bet no other kid in the whole world has ever eaten this much broccoli! [hopeful whisper] Maybe even three stories?
Character 2: [chuckling softly] Don't push your luck, munchkin. [lovingly] Two stories is fair. [teasingly] But only if you finish that last piece without making your "I'm dying" face. You know, the one you're making right now!
186 Character 1: [giggling] I'm not making a face! [protestingly] This is just how I look when I'm being the bravest. [triumphantly] There, all done! [sing-song voice] Now you have to keep your promise about stories and tomorrow's smoothie!
Character 2: [proudly] I'm so proud of you! [grateful sigh] Yes, promises are promises. [tenderly] Come on, let's go pick out those two stories. [whispered relief] And maybe mommy will have a big glass of wine after you're asleep.

Script: 7041f460 | Role: Character 1 (A)

187 Character 1: [tense] The seating chart needs to be finalized by tomorrow morning. [speaking rapidly] I've color-coded everyone by dietary restrictions, family dynamics, and [sharp exhale] conversation compatibility. [firmly] We cannot have Uncle Gerald near the bar or your college friends.
Character 2: [lazily] Tomorrow? [long yawn] Can't we just let people sit wherever they vibe? [chuckling] I mean, watching Uncle Gerald try to flirt with my college friends [slower] might actually be the entertainment we didn't know we needed.
188 Character 1: [high-pitched] Entertainment?! [gasping breath] This is my wedding, not some social experiment! [getting louder] The centerpieces alone cost three hundred dollars each, and I will not have chaos disrupting the ambiance I've spent months cultivating!
Character 2: [calmly] Three hundred per table? [soft whistle] Girl, for that price, they better be singing show tunes. [more relaxed] Look, people are coming for you two, not the flowers. [mumbling] Though singing flowers would be pretty cool.
189 Character 1: [through gritted teeth] The timeline says hair and makeup starts at six AM sharp. [urgent whisper] That means five-thirty arrival for prep. [snapping] I've already sent seventeen reminders to the group chat—did you even read them?
Character 2: [drowsily] Six in the morning? [groaning] The sun doesn't even know it exists then. [perking up slightly] How about we compromise—I'll bring coffee and donuts, [trailing off] and we'll call showing up by seven a win?
190 Character 1: [shrieking] Seven?! [choking sound] The photographer arrives at eight-fifteen! [frantically] We have exactly two hours and fifteen minutes for six people's complete transformations, [voice breaking] and you're suggesting we lose an entire hour?
Character 2: [soothingly] Breathe, honey, breathe. [gentle laugh] You know what? I'll set fourteen alarms. [more cheerfully] Plus, your cousin does makeup professionally—she could probably contour us all in her sleep. Everything will work out perfectly.
191 Character 1: [coldly] Speaking of perfection, the bachelorette party needs a detailed itinerary. [building intensity] I'm thinking wine tasting at two, spa at four, [loud] dinner at seven-thirty sharp! [controlling] Everyone must RSVP with their exact meal choices.
Character 2: [playfully] Or—hear me out—we could just show up somewhere fun? [giggling] Maybe hit that karaoke place downtown, [voice dropping] grab some tacos from that truck you love? [warmly] Sometimes the best nights aren't planned, they just happen.
192 Character 1: [exasperated sigh] "Just happen"? [incredulous] Do you know what "just happens" when things aren't planned? [voice rising] Disasters! Forgotten vendors! [practically screaming] Missing bridesmaids! The wrong flowers! Complete and utter chaos everywhere!
Character 2: [quietly] Okay, you're spiraling now. [more firmly] Remember your engagement party? [chuckle] Your printer broke, the caterer was late, but everyone said it was the best party ever. [tenderly] Because you were actually relaxed and happy.
193 Character 1: [defensively] That was different! [voice cracking] This is the actual wedding! [pleading] Two hundred people are watching, judging, taking photos that will exist forever! [whispered panic] What if something goes wrong and it's all anyone remembers?
Character 2: [steadily] Hey, look at me. [soft and slow] What they'll remember is you marrying your best friend. [getting stronger] They'll remember your happy tears, your terrible dancing, [laughing] and how you both couldn't stop smiling all night long.
194 Character 1: [wavering] You really think people won't care if the napkins don't match the invitations? [nervous laugh] I spent three weeks choosing between "ivory" and "cream." [more quietly] Sometimes I dream about color swatches attacking me at night.
Character 2: [amused] Color swatch nightmares? [louder laugh] Girl, you need a vacation after this vacation! [reassuringly] Listen, I promise to handle three things perfectly—just pick them. [diplomatically] You can control-freak the rest all you want.
195 Character 1: [hopefully] Really? You'd do that? [quick exhale] Okay, the processional timing, making sure Grandma takes her medication, and [firmly] keeping my mother away from the microphone during speeches. [lighter] Those are absolutely non-negotiable, life-or-death priorities.
Character 2: [confidently] Done, done, and absolutely done. [mischievous tone] I'll guard that mic like it's the last piece of wedding cake. [more seriously] Your mom's karaoke days are officially over. [whispering] At least until the after-party.
196 Character 1: [relieved sigh] Thank you. [becoming emotional] I know I'm being crazy, but this day has to be perfect. [voice softening] Not for Instagram or the guests, but [catching breath] because I've dreamed about this since I was seven.
Character 2: [warmly] And it will be perfect. [gentle] Not because every detail is planned, but because you're marrying him. [sighing happily] Plus, with me as your maid of honor, [jokingly] at least the disaster stories will be hilarious.

Script: de1ae717 | Role: Customer Support

Character 1: [angrily] Mr. Henderson, I'm standing here at 4782 Maple Drive looking at extensive water damage [voice rising] that wasn't mentioned anywhere in your report! [frustrated grunt] The entire basement ceiling is basically, um, falling apart—how did you miss this?
197 Customer Support: [defensive] Ma'am, I inspected that property on October 15th, report number HI-2023-8847. [more firmly] My documentation clearly states that I had limited access to the basement due to, uh, stored items blocking the area. [steadier] Did you not read page 17 of the inspection report?
Character 1: [sarcastically] Oh, page 17, of course! [louder] Listen, I paid $650 for a comprehensive inspection, not excuses about boxes! [accusingly] The damage extends at least, what, twelve feet across—you couldn't see ANY of that?
198 Customer Support: [irritated] Mrs. Rodriguez, I photographed everything visible during my three-hour inspection. [sighs heavily] The seller had stacked furniture and boxes up to the ceiling in that corner, specifically grid reference B-4 through B-7. [more defensive] I can't x-ray through people's belongings!
Character 1: [incredulous] Three hours? [scoffs] My contractor says this damage is at least two years old, maybe three! [demanding] The staining pattern shows it's been leaking since before—way before—your October visit!
199 Customer Support: [frustrated exhale] Look, moisture readings in adjacent areas showed 11-12% on my meter, completely normal range. [more insistent] Without visible access or elevated readings, I... I followed standard protocol ASHI-2019 guidelines. [firmly] Every inspection has limitations, which you acknowledged by signing!
Character 1: [voice shaking] This is going to cost me over $18,000 to repair! [desperate] My insurance claim number INS-44291-TX won't even cover it because it's pre-existing! [pleading] Can't you at least admit you should've investigated further?
200 Customer Support: [sympathetically] I understand you're upset, and eighteen thousand is... that's significant. [carefully] However, my liability is capped at the inspection fee per our contract, section 9.2.A. [sighs] Have you contacted the seller about disclosure obligations?
Character 1: [bitterly] The seller claims they didn't know either—convenient, right? [exhausted] My lawyer says without your report flagging it, we can't prove anything. [quietly furious] You've basically destroyed my case, Mr. Henderson.
201 Customer Support: [apologetically] Mrs. Rodriguez, I'll... I'll review my photos from that day again, check if anything was missed. [hesitant] Send me your contractor's report to inspector@hendersonhi.com, and perhaps we can, um, discuss a partial refund? [wearily] Though I maintain I followed proper procedures.

202 Character 1: [shouting] What do you mean my daughter has a broken arm?! [voice cracking] I dropped her off at 8:15 this morning perfectly fine, and now you're telling me she's at—at Memorial Hospital on 2847 Oak Street?!

Customer Support: D2: [apologetically] Mrs. Henderson, I understand you're upset. [steadier] Emma fell from the playground equipment around 10:30 AM, and we immediately called 911. [softer] Your emergency contact, your mother I believe, is already with her.
203 Character 1: [furiously] The playground equipment? [louder] Which one exactly, because I specifically filled out form 23-B stating she wasn't allowed on the climbing tower! [voice trembling] This is completely unacceptable!

Customer Support: D4: [nervously] Actually, it was the—the smaller slide structure, not the tower. [more calmly] According to our incident report number INJ-4521, she was going down backwards when another child accidentally bumped into her.
204 Character 1: [incredulous] Backwards?! [shouting] Where was the supervision? [sarcastically] Don't I pay $1,850 a month for you people to actually watch these kids?

Customer Support: D6: [defensive] Ms. Rodriguez was supervising, she has—has over 12 years of experience. [more firmly] The ratio was 1 to 6, well within state regulations. [quieter] Sometimes accidents just happen despite our best efforts.
205 Character 1: [voice breaking] Don't give me that! [more angrily] I want to see the security footage from cameras 3 and 4 in the playground area. [demanding] And I want copies of every single staff certification by tomorrow morning!

Customer Support: D8: [hesitant] The footage can be reviewed but, um, you'll need to submit a formal request to our main office at 5500 Wilshire Boulevard. [more confidently] However, I can email you the incident documentation right now to your registered email.
206 Character 1: [bitterly] Oh, how convenient, more paperwork! [louder] My four-year-old is in the hospital with a fractured radius, and you're worried about—about protocols? [scoffs] This is lawsuit material, you understand that?

Customer Support: D10: [pleading] Mrs. Henderson, please, we're—we're devastated this happened. [more sincerely] Our insurance claim number is already filed as CLM-789-2024A. [gently] Right now though, shouldn't you be heading to the hospital to be with Emma?
207 Character 1: [quieter] I'm already in my car, doing 75 on Interstate 405! [voice shaking] But don't think this conversation is over. [firmly] I want a meeting with the director Monday at 9 AM sharp!

Customer Support: D12: [relieved] Of course, I'll—I'll schedule that with Director Johnson immediately. [more professionally] She'll be in our conference room B at that time. [warmly] Please give Emma our best wishes for a speedy recovery.
208 Character 1: [sarcastically] Your best wishes? [louder] That's really helpful right now! [sighs heavily] Just have all the documentation ready, including Teacher Rodriguez's file and that other child's information.

Customer Support: D14: [cautiously] We can't release other children's information due to privacy laws, but, um, everything else will be prepared. [more assertively] The full report, staff schedules from today, and our safety inspection records from last month.
209 Character 1: [frustrated] Privacy laws! [groans] My baby is hurt and you're protecting the kid who caused this? [more controlled] Fine, but I want the parents contacted—room 4B, the Mitchell boy, right?

Customer Support: D16: [uncomfortably] I—I can't confirm any names, Mrs. Henderson. [steadier] But all involved parties' parents have been notified per our policy 7.3.2. [sympathetically] I know this is incredibly difficult for you.
210 Character 1: [exhausted] You have no idea. [voice cracking] She's four years old, she was so excited about show-and-tell today, brought her—her favorite stuffed unicorn. [sniffling] Now she's getting X-rays instead.

Customer Support: D18: [gently] We actually saved her unicorn, it's—it's safe in her cubby number 27. [more warmly] Ms. Rodriguez said Emma was very brave when it happened. [reassuringly] She even helped calm down the other children who were scared.
211 Character 1: [softer] She did? [sighs] That sounds like my Emma. [more firmly] Look, I'm pulling into the hospital now, parking garage level C-3. [determined] But this isn't over, not by a long shot.

Customer Support: D20: [understanding] Absolutely, we'll discuss everything on Monday. [sincerely] The incident report will be in your inbox within the hour, case reference DC-20241108-EM. [quietly] Please take care, Mrs. Henderson, and—and give Emma a hug from all of us.

--- BASIC SCENARIOS ---

212 [Slow] So, um, just gonna keep looking at that poster on the wall—is that, is that a beach or mountains? [Fast] I honestly can't tell from here.

213 [Happy] Hey, you know what, I'm actually doing pretty good—like, way better than last time! [Chuckle]

214 [Whisper] Okay, okay, breathing in... and out... just like they—wait, am I supposed to squeeze this thing now? [Sigh]

215 [Sarcastic] Oh sure, "just a little pinch," they said—more like a, uh, like a very aggressive mosquito, right? [Tsk]

216 [Fast] Is it normal that I can kinda hear my heartbeat or is that just—no, that's probably fine, totally fine.

217 [Sad] I really wanna help people, I do, but my arm is feeling so—I mean, it's worth it though. [Slow] Right?

218 [Angry] Why did I look—I specifically told myself not to look at the needle and then I just—ugh! [Groan]

219 [Disappointed] I thought I'd be, you know, braver about this whole thing by now. [Sigh] Guess not.

220 [Slow] The nurse seems nice—she's got, um, really steady hands, which is... that's good, that's what you want. [Chuckle]

221 Eight minutes, she said eight minutes, so that's basically—wait, has it only been two? [Fast] [Groan]

222 [Happy] You know what, I'm literally saving lives here, so a little—a little wooziness is nothing! [Laugh]

223 [Whisper] Don't think about the bag, don't think about the bag, don't think about—oh God, I'm thinking about the bag. [Tsk]

224 [Shout] Wait, is it supposed to feel cold like that? [Fast] That's—that's a normal sensation, right?

226 I'm gonna get juice after this, right—they promised juice and, um, maybe those little cookies? [Happy] [Fast]

227 [Slow] My mom always said I was brave for doing this, but honestly I just—I dunno if she'd still think that seeing me now. [Disappointed]

228 [Angry] No, no, I'm fine, I just—I hate when people hover, y'know? [Fast] Seriously, I got this!

229 [Whisper] If I just count ceiling tiles backwards from fifty, it'll be over before—forty-nine, forty-eight... [Slow]

230 [Sad] I keep thinking about all the people who need this and—actually, that kinda helps? [Sigh] Sort of?

231 [Happy] Almost done—wait, really, that's it? [Laugh] I basically psyched myself out over nothing!

232 SCENARIO: Matter-of-factly talking about a shared document they edited, then checking the history, then seeing everyone can see their embarrassing edit history, spiraling into document transparency horror
==================================================

[matter-of-fact]
So I, um, I finished editing that, uh, that quarterly report we've been working on. You know, the one with all the— all the budget projections? Yeah, I just, um, I cleaned up some of the formatting and added those, uh, those charts you mentioned.

[casual]
I was gonna, um, I was gonna send it back to everyone but then I thought, you know what, let me just— let me double-check what I changed first. So I, uh, I clicked on that little history thing, the, um, the version history tab, right?

[slightly uncomfortable]
And I'm scrolling through and I see all my edits and it's like, okay, fine, whatever, but then I notice— I notice it shows, um, it shows everything I typed. Like even the— even the stuff I deleted, you know? Which is, uh, which is weird but—

[realization dawning]
Wait. Wait, hang on. [nervous laugh] Oh no. Oh, um, oh god. It's showing— it's showing where I wrote "Dave is such an idiot" in the margins and then deleted it. And where I, um, I wrote "this budget is absolute garbage" and— [sharp exhale] and then changed it to "needs revision."

[spiraling]
Everyone can see this! Sarah, Dave, the, um, the whole executive team— they can all see where I called the CEO's presentation "mind-numbingly boring" before I— before I deleted it and wrote "comprehensive!" [groan] How long has this been— how long has everyone been able to see my, um, my uncensored thoughts about everything?

[panicked]
Oh my god, I've been, um, I've been editing documents for months thinking I was being so professional and— and diplomatic, but the whole time everyone could see me calling Janet's ideas "completely unhinged" and— [whimper] I'm never touching a shared document again. Never. I'm, um, I'm gonna have to quit. I have to quit my job because of Google Docs!
